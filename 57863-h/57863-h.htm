</div>


<p><span class="smcap">I believe</span> this volume serves a useful purpose. It is the fruit of a
suggestion which I made to its compiler, Mr. Hughes, in the following
circumstances.</p>

<p>At the beginning of last year I engaged in controversy in the <cite>Times</cite>
newspaper with certain persons who laboured under the delusion that the
evidence of Shakespeare’s authorship of those plays and poems, which
for three centuries have been published as his, was inconclusive. In
defiance of the fact that the acknowledged work of Bacon, the prose
writer and philosopher, proves him to be incapable of writing verse
of genuine merit, some of my opponents held Bacon and no other to be
responsible for those manifestations of supreme poetic genius which
are associated with Shakespeare’s name. Other sceptics, of less raw
judgment, hesitated to commit themselves to this extravagance,—they
confined themselves to the slightly more plausible contention that the
facts recorded of Shakespeare by contemporaries were scanty, and that
his career was clothed in a mystery, which justified wild attempts at a
solution.</p>

<p>The whole of the sceptical argument ignored alike the results of
recent Shakespearean research and the elementary truths of Elizabethan
literary history. But confirmed sceptics are not easily convinced
<!-- Page vi --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[vi]</a></span>of defects of knowledge. With especial emphasis did even the most
enlightened among those who declared their doubt in print, persist in
affirming that Shakespeare was unnoticed by his contemporaries, and
that his achievements failed to win reputation in his lifetime or in
the generations succeeding his death. It was that allegation, to a
greater degree than any other, which seemed to encourage the inference
that the received tradition of the Shakespearean authorship of the
plays needed revision.</p>

<p>The conjecture that Shakespeare lived and died unhonoured rests on no
foundation of fact. The converse alone is true. Shakespeare’s eminence
was fully acknowledged by his contemporaries, and their acknowledgments
have long been familiar to scholars.</p>

<p>Yet the reiterated assertion that Shakespeare’s contemporaries left
on record no recognition of his worth, proved that information on the
subject was narrowly diffused, and that public intelligence suffered
by the strait limits as yet assigned to the distribution of genuine
knowledge of the topic. I suggested to Mr. Hughes that he should
remedy this defect by collecting in a volume that might be generally
accessible all notices of Shakespeare which were penned in early days.</p>

<p>Subsequently, when I considered the scheme in detail, I deemed it wise
for Mr. Hughes to enlarge its scope so that the volume might form a
contribution to the history of opinion respecting Shakespeare of no
single period, but of all periods from the earliest to the present
day. Thereby the force and persistence of that Shakespearean tradition
which ignorance had lately impugned might be rendered plainer, and the
liability to misconception might be to a <!-- Page vii --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[vii]</a></span>greater degree diminished.
The fulfilment of the design on the extended scale might also, I
thought, give the work some value as a chart of æsthetic development
through the ages. Students of Shakespeare who in the course of three
centuries have recorded their impressions of him, include men and
women of varying degrees of intellectual capacity, and the orderly
presentation of their views could not fail to illustrate with some
graphic force the working of the law of taste in literature.</p>

<p>A further justification for the compilation of the work on an
exhaustive scale, lies in the fact that it has not been done already.
Charles Knight seems to be the only writer who has hitherto attempted
any sketch of a general history of opinion respecting Shakespeare. His
essay formed part of his <cite>Studies of Shakespeare</cite>, which were first
published in 1849, and it was reissued separately as the first volume
of a new edition of his Cabinet Edition of <cite>Shakespeare</cite> which was
published in London by William S. Orr <abbr title="and Company">&amp; Co.</abbr>, of Paternoster Row, in
1851.<a name="FNanchor_VII:1_1" id="FNanchor_VII:1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_VII:1_1" class="fnanchor">[vii:1]</a> Knight surveys his subject somewhat perfunctorily from
Edmund Spenser to Coleridge. He devotes much space to the eighteenth
century, but he pays scant attention to the nineteenth, and he is far
from exhaustive in his treatment of earlier periods. Commendable as is
his pioneer effort, it is now, alike in form and matter, largely out of
date.</p>

<p>A more imposing endeavour was made later to deal with the earlier
section of the topic. Dr. Ingleby, a <!-- Page viii --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[viii]</a></span>Shakespearean scholar of repute,
issued in 1874 the work entitled <cite>Shakespeare’s Centurie of Prayse</cite>,
in which he dealt with the period extending from the year 1591, when
Shakespeare first came into notice as a dramatist, until 1693. A
second edition of Dr. Ingleby’s volume, revised and enlarged by Miss
Toulmin Smith, appeared five years later under the auspices of the
New Shakspere Society. A very substantial supplement to this volume,
called <cite>Some 300 Fresh Allusions to Shakspere from 1594 to 1694</cite>, was
edited by Dr. Furnivall for the New Shakspere Society in 1886. Thus the
<cite>Centurie of Prayse</cite> in its final shape extends to 912 pages in quarto.
The large book is not at everybody’s disposal, but its contents, as far
as they go, are very valuable, and no Shakespeare library is complete
without it. None the less, it covers less than a third part of that
field which a full history of opinion about Shakespeare ought to
occupy; it leaves ample room for a treatise on the whole subject.</p>

<p>The general impression produced by Mr. Hughes’s extended survey seems
creditable to the discernment of the English literary public—of
all generations since Shakespeare began to write. The repute that
Shakespeare acquired in his lifetime, though it was rarely defined
with subtlety, was in spirit all that judicious admirers could desire.
The contemporary estimate was authoritatively summed up in the epitaph
which was inscribed on his monument in Stratford-on-Avon church soon
after his death. In that inscription he was hailed as the equal of
great heroes of classical antiquity—of Nestor in wisdom, of Socrates
in genius, of Virgil in literary art; he was acknowledged in plain
terms to be the greatest of <!-- Page ix --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[ix]</a></span>contemporary writers; all living writers
were declared to be worthy only to serve him as pages or menials.
Shakespeare’s epitaph, the significance of which is not always
appreciated, justifies no doubt of the supremacy that he enjoyed in
the English world of letters of his own day. The homage of literary
contemporaries was confirmed without faltering and in finer phrase by
Milton, the next occupant of the throne of English letters.</p>

<p>No subsequent change of literary taste or literary fashion in England
really dimmed Shakespeare’s fame. In the days of the Restoration,
Dryden humbly acknowledged discipleship to him. Some censure he
suffered from thoughtless lips; but the right to the rank of a classic,
which had been granted him as soon as the breath left his body, was
never effectually disputed. The formal critics of the eighteenth
century sought to show that much of his work deviated from formal
standards or from rules of formal art. But these censors gave him the
worship of incessant study. They edited and annotated his writings,
with the result that a succeeding generation of readers acquired a
more accurate comprehension of his work than was possible before.
The triumphal progress of Shakespeare’s reputation was stimulated by
eighteenth century research and criticism to a quicker pace.</p>

<p>The critical faculty of the nation was especially acute and sagacious
at the opening of the nineteenth century, and Shakespeare’s
pre-eminence was then seen in sharper outline and in fuller grandeur
than at any earlier epoch. The sympathetic intuition of three early
nineteenth century critics—Coleridge, Lamb, and Hazlitt—remains
unsurpassed. But there has been no trace of retrogression in the wise
<!-- Page x --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[x]</a></span>and reasoned enthusiasm of later generations of the reading public.</p>

<p>The history of Shakespeare’s fame is indeed that of a flowing tide; the
ebbing was never long enough sustained to give it genuine importance;
the forward march was never seriously impeded, and is from start
to finish the commanding feature of the chronicle. If Mr. Hughes’s
endeavour succeed in impressing that pregnant fact on the public mind,
a perilous source of popular misconception regarding Shakespeare’s true
place in English literary history will be removed.</p>

INTRODUCTORY</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">This</span> book provides a chronological sequence of the best pieces in verse
and prose which the best writers in successive periods have written
in praise of Shakespeare, and thereby aims at presenting, as it were,
an index to the standard of estimation in which Shakespeare has been
held at any given point of time. Thus, as an anthology, it differs in
various respects from other anthologies. An anthology, as a rule, hopes
to confine itself to pieces of literature intrinsically valuable. The
conscientious compiler of an ordinary anthology includes nothing which,
according to his own canons of taste, can be considered of doubtful
merit. His choice may not always be approved by others—it frequently
is not; but he, at least, is satisfied. Here, however, is a different
case. My object has been to collect what may be called materials for a
history of opinion of Shakespeare, so that as many years <!-- Page 2 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>as might be
of the three centuries and more, which have elapsed since Shakespeare’s
reputation was born, had to be represented. With these conditions it
has not always been possible to exclude bad pieces, for the obvious
reason that there has been at times a dearth of good writers. In such
cases the best has been given that could be found. The best has at
times been deplorably mediocre, but the scheme was inexorable.</p>

<p>The labour of selection has been guided by one or two principles.
In the first place, complete poems, or extracts in verse and prose,
which relate solely to Shakespeare have been taken in preference to
those which mention him in company with his contemporaries. Secondly,
passages that exhibit unusual characteristics, whether good or bad,
have frequently been chosen. For some of the poor pieces, and I hope
they are not many, something may be said. Though their writers are
practically forgotten to-day, they were considered great during their
own lives; so their productions have at least a historical value. If,
then, this volume includes, as I think it does, the best things that
have been written about Shakespeare, it includes also many things
that in a comparative estimate of the whole must be considered as
second-rate, though they happened to be the best in the period during
which they were produced. The distinctiveness of the book may perhaps
be indicated in this way. An ordinary anthology may be said to gather
into a garland the choicest flowers from various fields of literature;
this anthology claims to be little more than a collection of botanical
specimens.</p>

<h3><abbr title="Two">II</abbr><br />

DIVISION INTO PERIODS</h3>

<p>The history of opinion of Shakespeare may be divided into three
periods, represented broadly by the seventeenth, eighteenth, and
nineteenth centuries. Definite limits cannot be assigned to these three
periods. Epochs of literary history must be determined ultimately,
not by the work produced in them, or by the lives of the producers,
but by the influences which gradually brought them into being. Thus,
there must always be at the beginning and end of a period of literary
history a kind of dovetailing with it of the periods before and after.
Still, the three periods I have indicated are reasonably distinct.
The first begins with the earliest mention of Shakespeare in print,
and may be taken to end with the death of Dryden. The second period
was largely affected by Dryden’s influence, and thus may be said to
begin with the eighteenth century. And the last period, which is due
to the reaction from the Augustan age of English literature, may be
fairly dated from the beginning of the nineteenth century. The style
of the literary products of these three centuries respectively goes to
confirm the division. The first period is that of personal knowledge
and oral tradition, and tributes to Shakespeare are for the most part
in verse. It is the period during which his historical position was in
the making. The second period is that of critics and emendators—the
period when people begin to realise that there is some great power in
Shakespeare’s work which <!-- Page 4 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>finds no parallel in their own time, and must
therefore be praised blindly, accounted for, or explained away. Tribute
is clothed equally in verse and prose; it is, in short, the period of
doubt and astonishment. The last period is that of æsthetic criticism,
and tribute is mostly in prose. Shakespeare’s position is an accepted
fact.</p>

<p>Of the three periods, the second is by far the most interesting to the
literary historian. Opinion of Shakespeare during the first period
was to a large extent prejudiced by personal knowledge and tradition.
The praise is practically equivalent to that of friends; which is to
say, it is largely that of blind admiration. In the third period it
is open-eyed, intelligent admiration. The matter has been sifted. The
question of Shakespeare’s genius is no longer a debatable point. The
praise is that of disciples who appreciate the logical basis of their
master’s teaching, and who see the necessity of lucid explanation
for the purpose of adding recruits to their number. But the second
period is the time of trial. Shakespeare’s title to fame is weighed
judicially, and is not found wanting.</p>


<h3><abbr title="Three">III</abbr><br />

THE FIRST PERIOD</h3>

<p>Of the seventeenth century not much need be said, and, indeed, not
much that is new can be said. The labours of the New Shakspere Society
have added several valuable volumes to the literature relating to
Shakespeare’s reputation during that period. Of these the <cite>Centurie of
Prayse</cite> <!-- Page 5 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>(of which the second and much enlarged edition was produced
under the direction of Miss <abbr title="Lucy">L.</abbr> Toulmin Smith in 1879) brought together
a very large number of allusions to Shakespeare both in print and
manuscript, and these were supplemented by <cite>Some 300 Fresh Allusions</cite>,
a work which was edited by Dr. Furnivall in 1886. These volumes display
an amazing amount of diligent research, and few additions can be made
to their contents. Seven hitherto unnoticed allusions to Shakespeare
were discovered by Dr. Edward <abbr title="John Long">J. L.</abbr> Scott in the Sloane Manuscripts
at the British Museum, and communicated by him to the <cite>Athenæum</cite>
on 5th March 1898.<a name="FNanchor_5:1_2" id="FNanchor_5:1_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_5:1_2" class="fnanchor">[5:1]</a> This evidence of Shakespeare’s reputation
during the period under discussion has been ably supplemented by an
article entitled <cite>Shakespeare in Oral Tradition</cite>, which Mr. Sidney
Lee contributed to the <cite>Nineteenth Century</cite> in January 1902. This
traces the actual recollection of Shakespeare by his friends and their
descendants, from his personal acquaintance among the actors and the
townsfolk of Stratford-on-Avon, to the reminiscences transmitted
by word of mouth from Betterton to Nicholas Rowe, the poet’s first
biographer. Mr. Lee’s paper is of the utmost importance. As he
points out, “It was obviously the free circulation of the fame of
Shakespeare’s work which stimulated the activity <!-- Page 6 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>of interest in his
private fortunes, and led to the chronicling of the oral tradition
regarding them. It could easily be shown that outside the circle
of professional poets, dramatists, actors, and fellow-townsmen,
Shakespeare’s name was, from his first coming into public notice,
constantly on the lips of scholars, statesmen, and men of fashion who
had any glimmer of literary taste.”</p>

<p>The ground, therefore, may be said to be covered in so far as positive
evidence of Shakespeare’s fame in the seventeenth century is concerned.
But at least three popular fallacies have come into being, and it
will be perhaps worth while to state them and definitely refute them.
Their existence is due partly to lack of acquaintance with documentary
evidence, and partly to misconception.</p>

<p>One of these popular fallacies is that Shakespeare practically vanished
from the minds of his countrymen when he retired from the stage; and
that what reputation he had in his lifetime was due to his prominence
as an actor, rather than to his genius as a poet.</p>

<p>The preface of the First Folio (1623) is enough to prove that this was
not the case. The tone of the address “to the great variety of readers”
is not that of publishers trying to awaken interest in a forgotten
personage, by calling attention to works that used to be popular. The
language is that of affectionate friends, the references to Shakespeare
those of intimate associates whose memories have not healed of the
wound inflicted by his death. It was addressed to the public, not with
the diffidence that is born of anxiety lest the subject of eulogy
should meet with an indifferent welcome, but with the confidence that
is <!-- Page 7 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>inspired by friendship with a great man who is recognised as a
great man.</p>

<p>The second impression of the Folio appeared in 1632, and the spirit of
enthusiasm that breathes through the preliminary matter—the publisher’s
preface and the various sets of verses—has become in no way weakened.
The volume contains, indeed, two of the finest poems of direct personal
eulogy that have ever been written—that signed <abbr class="spell">I. M. S.</abbr>, and attributed
by Coleridge somewhat fancifully to no less a person than John Milton,
and the noble <cite>Epitaph on the admirable Dramatic Poet, W. Shakespeare</cite>,
actually written by Milton in 1630. No sign of decayed reputation
here. Nor elsewhere. King Charles <abbr title="the first"><span class="allcapsc">I.</span></abbr>, it is well known, read
Shakespeare. Copies of his plays and poems are mentioned in Prince
Rupert’s library catalogue. His works were given on the stage, and
formed topics of everyday discussion. One might multiply examples of
his popularity, but it is striking at shadows.</p>

<p>Another popular error has tinged the traditional notion of Milton’s
attitude to Shakespeare. It is supposed that his opinion of Shakespeare
underwent a complete change from that exhibited in the lines mentioned
above. The error that attributes to Milton this surprising revulsion
of feeling is due to a misconception of a certain passage in his
<cite>Eikonoklastes</cite>. Milton wrote thus:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“Andronicus Comnenus, the Byzantine emperor, though a most
cruel tyrant, is reported by Nicetas to have been a most
constant reader of Saint Paul’s Epistles; and by continual
study had so incorporated the phrase and style of that
transcendent apostle into all his familiar letters, that the
imitation seemed to vie with the original. Yet this <!-- Page 8 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>availed
not to deceive the people of that empire, who, notwithstanding
his saint’s vizard, tore him to pieces for his tyranny. From
stories of this nature, both ancient and modern, which abound,
the poets also, and some English, have been in this point so
mindful of decorum as to put never more pious words in the
mouth of any person than of a tyrant. I shall not instance an
abstruse author, wherein the king might be less conversant, but
one whom we well know was the closet companion of these his
solitudes, William Shakespeare, who introduces the person of
Richard the Third, speaking in as high a strain of piety and
mortification as is uttered in any passage of this book [<i>i.e.</i>
the <cite>Eikon Basilike</cite>], and sometimes to the same sense and
purpose with some words in this place: ‘I intended,’ saith he,
‘not only to oblige to my friends, but my enemies.’ The like
saith Richard, Act <abbr title="Two">II.</abbr> Scene <abbr title="One">i.</abbr>:</p>

<div class="poem">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="line">“‘I do not know that Englishman alive</div>
    <div class="line indentq2">With whom my soul is any jot at odds,</div>
    <div class="line indentq2">More than the infant that is born to-night:</div>
    <div class="line indentq2">I thank my God for my humility.’</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Other stuff of this sort may be read throughout the whole
tragedy, wherein the poet used not much licence in departing
from the truth of history, which delivers him a deep
dissembler, not of his affections only, but of religion.”</p></div>

<p>The blundering interpretation of this passage, which Warton accepted
and transmitted to his successors, including De Quincey, is that
Charles <abbr title="the First"><span class="allcapsc">I.</span></abbr> was reproved by Milton for having made Shakespeare
his closet companion. “The Prince of Wales (afterwards Charles
<abbr title="the First"><span class="allcapsc">I.</span></abbr>),” says De Quincey in his <cite>Life of Shakespeare</cite>, “had
learned to appreciate Shakespeare, not originally from reading him, but
from witnessing the Court representations of his plays at Whitehall.
Afterwards we know that he made Shakespeare <!-- Page 9 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>his closet companion,
for he was reproached with doing so by Milton.” A careful perusal
of the passage will show that nothing was farther from Milton’s
intention. Such a deduction is logically impossible. Three things,
however, undoubtedly may be deduced from it; and they not only bear
a significance directly opposed to the erroneous interpretation, but
they are of the highest importance as positive evidence of Milton’s
appreciation of Shakespeare, and of Shakespeare’s literary fame. One
may deduce, firstly, that Shakespeare was known, at any rate by name,
to the Puritans, who chiefly composed the public for which Milton was
writing. Secondly (since Charles was not, we may believe, the man to
read in private books that he did not like), that the king’s knowledge
of Shakespeare was intimate and his appreciation sincere. And, thirdly,
that Shakespeare was, in Milton’s opinion, one who depicts human nature
with accuracy. For, consider the force of the parallel. Milton wrote
to show that the deeds of monarchs are not always the substantiation
of their words. The Byzantine tyrant, with his mouth full of piety, is
cited as one instance; Shakespeare’s Richard <span class="allcapsc">III.</span> as being, by
familiarity, likely to bring the matter home to Charles, is cited as
another. Which is, in effect, that Shakespeare’s portrayal of a king
of such character is, in Milton’s opinion, proof that such a king may
exist. There is nothing slighting about that. It is high praise.</p>

<p>Milton wrote his <cite>Eikonoklastes</cite> in 1649, when he was forty-one. In
1645 he had written his <cite>L’Allegro</cite>, with the lines:</p>

<div class="poem">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="line">“Then to the well-trod stage anon</div>
    <div class="line indentq">If Jonson’s learned sock be on,</div>
    <div class="line indentq">Or sweetest Shakespeare fancy’s child,</div>
    <div class="line indentq">Warble his native woodnotes wild.”</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p><!-- Page 10 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
The lines attributed to him in the Second Folio had appeared in 1632,
and his fully authenticated <cite>Epitaph</cite> in 1630. Further, his influence
has been traced in the notice of Shakespeare which appeared in the
<cite lang="la" xml:lang="la">Theatrum Poetarum</cite>, published in 1675 by Edward Phillips, Milton’s
nephew. Here, surely, is sufficient evidence that throughout his life
Milton’s early enthusiasm for Shakespeare did not diminish.</p>

<p>A third popular fallacy is that which maintains Shakespeare’s
reputation to have been at its lowest ebb after the Restoration. This
belief is well expressed in Victor Hugo’s <cite>Shakespeare</cite>.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“Shakespeare,” says Victor Hugo, “once dead entered into
oblivion. Under the Restoration he ‘completed his eclipse.’
He was so thoroughly dead that Davenant, possibly his son,
recomposed his pieces. There was no longer any <cite>Macbeth</cite> but
the <cite>Macbeth</cite> of Davenant. Dryden speaks of Shakespeare on
one occasion in order to say that he is ‘out of date.’ Lord
Shaftesbury calls him ‘a wit out of fashion’&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>“These two men having condemned Shakespeare, the oracle had
spoken. England, a country more obedient to conventional
opinion than is generally believed, forgot Shakespeare. Some
purchaser pulled down his house, New Place. A <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> Dr. Gastrell
cut down and burnt his mulberry-tree.<a name="FNanchor_10:1_3" id="FNanchor_10:1_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_10:1_3" class="fnanchor">[10:1]</a> At the commencement
of the eighteenth century the eclipse was total. In 1707 one
called Nahum Tate published a <cite>King Lear</cite>, warning his readers
‘that he had borrowed the idea of it from a play which he
had read by chance, the work of some nameless author.’ This
‘nameless author’ was Shakespeare.”</p></div>

<p>Now the numerous adaptations of Shakespeare’s plays <!-- Page 11 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>which appeared
after the Restoration have been taken somewhat paradoxically as
indicative of his decline in the public estimation. Such a deduction is
by no means accurate. If we take into consideration the comparatively
low level to which imaginative literature had fallen under the
influence of Charles <abbr title="the Second"><span class="allcapsc">II.</span></abbr>’s Court, the wonder is perhaps that
the theatre-going public should have received Shakespeare in any form.
Such neglect of Shakespeare as is seen at this time is attributable
merely to change of fashion in popular literature, and that was then,
and still is, as mutable as the sea. Popular literature does not live,
and the adaptations of the later Stuart reigns are now known only to
curious students. But Shakespeare lived through it all, known and
appreciated by all who had souls above the vulgar; and in this very
period he passed triumphantly his first examination at the hands of a
skilled critic, John Dryden. Dryden was in every respect typical of the
cultivated class of his period. His early judgment of Shakespeare was
formed in the somewhat flickering light of Restoration taste. His final
estimate was that of a matured thinker. Certainly, adaptations prepared
to suit the fickle taste of the playgoer of the period cannot be said
to reflect the true character of Shakespeare’s reputation. We see the
same thing at the present day. The altruism of theatrical managers
is compelled to make concessions to popular demands. The public are
still rather shy of going to see Shakespeare simply as Shakespeare.
They appear to feel that going to see a play of Shakespeare is like
sacrificing themselves for their own good. So the managers who gild
the pill for them are successful, and those who do not merely fail,
or at best earn a precarious livelihood. One <!-- Page 12 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>might as well say that
Shakespeare’s reputation is at a very low ebb to-day, as make the
deduction from the fact of the Restoration adaptations. The playgoers
of that period wanted something piquant. One may suppose—to put the
matter in modern terms—that Heine and De Maupassant collaborating might
have produced a popular success. Wycherley and Congreve met the demand
as nearly as possible. But Shakespeare was not the thing.</p>


<h3><abbr title="Four">IV</abbr><br />

THE SECOND PERIOD</h3>

<p>I have taken 1700, the date of Dryden’s death, as that which most
fittingly marks the close of the first period and the beginning of
the second, for it is very soon after that year that the spirit of
the eighteenth century begins to make itself manifest. In the history
of literature the eighteenth century stands out distinct as a whole.
The literature of the seventeenth century had many characteristics,
which, even in the most cursory survey, require attention, and these
characteristics were mainly due to the connection of literature with
the Court. The pedantic James <abbr title="the First"><span class="allcapsc">I.</span></abbr> was a patron of learning. His
son Charles  <abbr title="the First"><span class="allcapsc">I.</span></abbr>, and grandson Charles <abbr title="the Second"><span class="allcapsc">II.</span></abbr>, inherited
the taste for polite letters, and encouraged or influenced indirectly
the authors of their times. But the eighteenth century monarchs were
different. They did not concern themselves much with men of letters,
and literature went its course comparatively unaffected by fashion. But
it was affected by the spirit of <!-- Page 13 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>the age—the spirit born of gradual
recognition of the Renaissance. As David Lloyd in his <cite>State Worthies</cite>
said of the early seventeenth century, “it was the very guise at that
time to be learned; the wits of it were so excellent, the helps and
assistants of it were so great; printing was so common; the world (by
navigation) so open; great experiments so disclosed; the leisure of men
so much, the age so peaceable; and His Majesty, after whom all writ,
so knowing.” At that time learning was a novelty, and consequently it
was fashionable—it was “the very guise.” By the eighteenth century
great men had grown accustomed to it; and it was becoming the property
of the lesser worthies, who, unable to resist the temptation to “show
off,” turned out reams of didactic verse, the substance of which would
nowadays hide its light beneath the respectable bushel of the journal
of some scientific society. Dryden was perhaps mainly responsible.
He had pronounced the dictum: “They cannot be good poets who are not
accustomed to argue well.” At any rate, with the eighteenth century the
poetry of argument or logic, as distinct from that of inspiration, came
into being, and by far the greater part of the poetry of the hundred
years that followed Dryden’s death was that of poets who are made
rather than poets who are born. The same feeling informs the prose.
It is true that the age produced Horace Walpole. But Walpole was a
literary trifler, and liked to be thought so, though he was amazingly
industrious. The eighteenth century saw much excellent prose, but it is
almost always the prose of “will” or “must” rather than that of “can.”
It comes rather of fertility of reason than of fertility of fancy. Of
such stock are commentators born.</p>

<p><!-- Page 14 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
One finds, accordingly, that the principal producers of pure
literature, whether prose or verse, were also critics, and most of them
turned their attention, sooner or later, to Shakespeare. Prominent
figures in the history of Shakespearean criticism in the eighteenth
century stand Pope and Johnson. Both are classical scholars in an age
of pedants; both are among the foremost advocates of rigid adherence
to prescribed rules in literary production; both place imagination
below intellect in estimation of genius; and both are honoured by
their fellows as arbiters and dictators of literary taste. Each of
them is inclined to say unkind things about Shakespeare, and hardly
dares. Pope is the more generous of the two. “It will be,” he says,
“but fair to allow that most of our author’s faults are less to be
ascribed to his wrong judgment as a poet, than to his right judgment
as a player.” Which is to say, that Shakespeare, poor soul! must needs
trim his boat to suit the current of popular opinion; that the greater
part of his audience in the theatres consisted of low fellows who had
never heard of Aristotle, and must not be troubled with the unities and
such matters, which they could not understand. One has but to continue
this line of argument to conclude that Pope thought Shakespeare so
much a part and product of the age in which he was born, that had
he been born, say, in Pope’s age, he might (which Heaven forbid!)
have been a perfect poet according to Pope’s lights—might, in fact,
have translated Homer, to supply the sixpenny boxes of second-hand
booksellers two centuries later. But Pope certainly thought Shakespeare
very great. His greatness was, perhaps, not of quite the right kind
in Pope’s estimation; but greatness he undoubtedly thought it. As to
<!-- Page 15 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>Shakespeare’s want of learning, Pope frankly refused to believe in it.
He says very wisely:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“There is certainly a vast difference between <em>learning</em> and
<em>languages</em>. How far he was ignorant of the latter I cannot
determine; but ’tis plain he had much reading at least, if they
will not call it learning. Nor is it any great matter, if a
man has knowledge, whether he has it from one language or from
another.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I am inclined to think this opinion proceeded
originally from the zeal of the partizans of our author and Ben
Jonson, as they endeavoured to exalt the one at the expense of
the other. It is ever the nature of parties to be in extremes;
and nothing is so probable as that because Ben Jonson had much
the more learning, it was said on the one hand that Shakespeare
had none at all; and because Shakespeare had much the most wit
and fancy, it was reported on the other that Jonson wanted
both. Because Shakespeare borrowed nothing, it was said that
Ben Jonson borrowed everything. Because Jonson did not write
extempore, he was reproached with being a year about every
piece; and because Shakespeare wrote with ease and rapidity,
they cried, he never once made a blot. Nay, the spirit of
opposition ran so high, that whatever those of the one side
objected to in the other, was taken at the rebound and turned
into praises; as injudiciously as their antagonists before had
made them objections.”</p>
</div>

<p>Pope further attributed many of Shakespeare’s errors to the
carelessness or ignorance of the first publishers of his works,
suggesting that the original copies from which they were printed were
no better than the “<em>prompter’s book</em>, or <em>piecemeal parts</em> written out
for the use of the actors,” who <!-- Page 16 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>may be supposed to have made numerous
small excisions and additions.</p>

<p>Thus Pope says in effect that Shakespeare would have been perfect if
the age and conditions in which he lived had allowed him. He sees many
beauties in him, but he also sees many defects; and his edition of
Shakespeare’s works is remarkable chiefly for its omissions of passages
which the editor deems unworthy of his author.</p>

<p>Dr. Johnson is by no means so ready metaphorically to grasp Shakespeare
by the hand. He follows a procession of editors of more or less
ability, and he feels that the time has come for the final settlement
of Shakespeare’s true position. Rowe, the first editor, hardly realised
his responsibilities, and his edition of the plays which appeared
in 1709 has few merits from the critic’s point of view. Pope, who
followed him in 1725, had a reputation for brilliance to sustain,
and his preface is remarkable rather for neatness of expression
than for critical discernment. Theobald came after Pope, in 1733,
with much common sense, which made him the laughing-stock of his
successors. The next editor, Sir Thomas Hanmer, intended his edition
as a tribute to Shakespeare, and what was lacking in criticism was
supplied in good paper and printing. Warburton succeeded with a pompous
self-assertiveness that expressed itself in amusing but ineffective
paradoxes.</p>

<p>Johnson accordingly had a due sense of what was expected of him. His
critical equipment consisted in a knowledge of the classical drama,
and his æsthetic judgment was founded on the rules by which he had
succeeded in his own poetical ventures. Still, he did his best to
assume a strictly unbiassed judicial attitude. He did not, <!-- Page 17 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>as Macaulay
states, take it for granted that “the kind of poetry which flourished
in his own time, which he had been accustomed to hear praised from
his childhood, and which he had himself written with success, was the
best kind of poetry.” He tried deliberately to approach Shakespeare
as he approached the Cock Lane Ghost. He dealt with him as with some
mysterious phenomenon which was attracting public attention, and which
admitted of explanation. The result was, perhaps, the best balanced
common-sense judgment on record. It contained, on the one hand, the
most tremendous indictment of Shakespeare that is ever likely to be
written; and, on the other, a triumphant defence, coupled with much
enthusiastic eulogy. Here are some of the “faults which,” as he puts
it, “are sufficient to obscure and overwhelm any other merit”:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“He sacrifices virtue to convenience.”</p>

<p>“His plots are often so loosely formed that a very slight
consideration may improve them.”</p>

<p>“In many of his plays the latter part is evidently neglected.”</p>

<p>“He had no regard to distinction of time or place.”</p>

<p>“In his comic scenes he is seldom very successful when he
engages his characters in reciprocations of smartness and
contests of sarcasm.”</p>

<p>“In tragedy his performance seems constantly to be worse, as
his labour is more.”</p>

<p>“In narration he affects a disproportionate pomp of diction and
a wearisome train of circumlocution, and tells the incident
imperfectly in many words, which might have been more plainly
delivered in few.”</p>

<p>“His declamations or set speeches are commonly cold and weak.”</p>

<p><!-- Page 18 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
“It is incident to him to be now and then entangled with an
unwieldy sentiment, which he cannot well express and will not
reject.”</p>

<p>“What he does best he soon ceases to do.”</p>

<p>“A quibble is to Shakespeare what luminous vapours are to the
traveller; he follows it at all adventures.”</p>

<p>“He neglects the unities—those laws which have been instituted
and established by the joint authority of poets and critics.”</p>
</div>

<p>Johnson proceeds to defend Shakespeare by an excellent demonstration
of the absurdity of the unities, and at the close of it owns himself
“almost frighted at his own temerity.” Then he follows Pope in finding
Shakespeare to be hampered by the age in which he lived. “The English
nation, in the time of Shakespeare, was yet struggling to emerge from
barbarity.” Having to appeal to immature intellects, he was compelled
to base his plays on novels and traditions well known to his audience,
“for his audience could not have followed him through the intricacies
of the drama had they not held the thread of the story in their
hands.” In reply to Voltaire, who expressed wonder that Shakespeare’s
extravagances should be endured by a nation which had seen the tragedy
of <cite>Cato</cite>, Johnson says that “Addison speaks the language of poets, and
Shakespeare of men.” He proceeds to deal with Shakespeare’s learning,
and Shakespeare emerges from the ordeal credited with rather less than
the average board-school boy of the present day. Johnson decides at
length that “if much of his praise is paid by perception and judgment,
much is likewise given by custom and veneration”; <!-- Page 19 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>and, finally, he
sums up his merits in the following fine sentence:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“It therefore is the praise of Shakespeare, that his drama is
the mirror of life; that he who has mazed his imagination, in
following the phantoms which other writers raise up before him,
may here be cured of his delirious ecstasies, by reading human
sentiments in human language; by scenes from which a hermit may
estimate the transactions of the world, and a confessor predict
the progress of the passions.”<a name="FNanchor_19:1_4" id="FNanchor_19:1_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_19:1_4" class="fnanchor">[19:1]</a></p>
</div>

<p>It is difficult in the face of these pros and cons to determine
what Johnson’s attitude towards Shakespeare really was. Much of his
apparent hostility may, perhaps, be attributed to his instinctive
argumentativeness. It was his nature to object. If he were in a
loquacious mood, you had but to make a bald statement, and he was
upon you with an aggressively persuasive “Why, sir!” And here it may
be that he felt irresistibly impelled to combat the universal opinion
of Shakespeare’s greatness, and that he was hardly sincere in all he
wrote. However this may be, it is probable that he left on his readers
the impression that the balance of his inclination was against rather
than for Shakespeare. The very fact of the judicial attitude would
<!-- Page 20 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>tend to produce such an impression. A judicial attitude towards
Shakespeare was not at that period so well understood as to be readily
distinguished from unfriendliness. And in estimating the critical
attitude of the age towards Shakespeare, it is necessary to bear in
mind that Dr. Johnson was a more important person when he lived than he
is now. Nothing is gained by speculating what he might have thought.
The fact remains that what he wrote carried weight.</p>

<p>Johnson’s opinion was not, however, sufficiently weighty to make his
preface, as he intended it to be, the last word in Shakespearean
criticism. Other editors followed him. Edward Capell brought much
serious and laborious scholarship to the task; and his judgments were
frequently sound, though his lack of perspicuity in delivering them
detracts somewhat from their value. His edition appeared in 1768. Five
years later, in 1773, George Steevens revised Johnson’s edition, and,
bringing to the enterprise an unrivalled knowledge of Elizabethan
history and literature, embodied many improvements, which he treated
with a humour that was frequently malicious and occasionally obscene.
To the second edition (1778) of this work was added much valuable
material relating to Shakespeare’s biography and the sources of his
plots, due to the researches of Edmund Malone, who published an
edition of his own in 1790. The well-known “First Variorum” edition
appeared in twenty-one volumes in 1803, prepared by Isaac Reed from a
1793 copy of Steevens’, containing many manuscript notes. The “Second
Variorum” appeared in 1813; and the “Third Variorum,” arranged by James
Boswell, the son of Johnson’s biographer, which appeared in 1821, marks
the <!-- Page 21 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>close of what may be called the eighteenth century period of
commentators.</p>

<p>It will be seen, then, that Shakespeare was at this time kept
prominently before the eyes of the reading public. He was equally a
topic of interest with men of letters who confined themselves to no
special branch of literature. The attitude of the eighteenth century
essayists toward Shakespeare was essentially one of admiration and
respect for his genius. They found fault with his plays, it is true,
frequently enough, but almost always apologetically. He was not
infrequently held up as a model for modern dramatists to follow. The
<cite>Connoisseur</cite>, for example, printed a paper discussing the sources
of the <cite>Merchant of Venice</cite>; and while elaborating the fact that
the plot was borrowed, insisted on the genius displayed in the use
which Shakespeare made of it. The <cite>Guardian</cite>, again, enlarges on the
naturalness of Shakespeare’s characters—remarkable at a time when
poetry was, above all things, rhetorical and artificial.</p>

<p>Let us glance now at the poetical critics. It will be noticed that
many of the pieces printed in the body of this book appear under
names that are not very familiar, and that the eighteenth century is
responsible for the majority of them. In modern anthologies it is not
usual to include selections from the works of such poets; nor, indeed,
if literary excellence be the compiler’s object, is it expedient.
They are included here not because their effusions appear to me to
reach even a modest standard of merit, but because they were accepted
as good poets by their contemporaries and by the literary dictator,
Dr. Johnson. Johnson, it is true, disclaimed responsibility for the
<!-- Page 22 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>choice of names represented in his edition of British poets, but the
repudiation cannot be considered of much importance. Johnson’s name
had probably more weight with publishers than that of any other man
of his time, and it is hardly likely that his advice in the matter of
inclusion or rejection, had he thought it worth while to give it, would
have been ignored. So one may feel certain that every name on his list
appeared with his approval. The laudatory criticisms embodied in the
biographies, which he asserted marked the extent of his commission,
prove as much. Take Blackmore, for example, whose <cite>Creation</cite> was
included, on Johnson’s recommendation, in his edition of the poets.
“This poem,” he says, “if he had written nothing else, would have
transmitted him to posterity among the first favourites of the English
Muse.” Posterity, on the whole, has not given the Muse’s favourite much
of a welcome, and Blackmore is one of a number of such chosen ones. But
even Johnson might have known better. They had their reputations ready
made for them by patrons. It was the age of patrons and extravagant
compliment, and Shakespeare in the hands of these small poets took a
place similar to that of the gods and goddesses of Greece and Rome.
Poetical flatterers of great men permitted him to fill the position of
comparative in the scale of eulogy, the object of their praises being
the superlative. Just as the writers of light society compliments made
envious Venus second to Clorinda or Chloe or Celia, so Shakespeare
stood aside to find himself excelled by Addison or Pope or Dryden, or
even, on exceptional occasions, by some patron who scarcely did more
than pretend to throw off <!-- Page 23 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>little trifles in verse. Witness the “Lines
to Mr. Addison,” by William Somervile:</p>

<div class="poem">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="line">“In heaven he [Shakespeare] sings; on earth your muse supplies</div>
    <div class="line indentq">Th’ important loss, and heals our weeping eyes.”</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Or take these lines by John Hughes, “To Mr. Addison on his Tragedy of
<cite>Cato</cite>”:</p>

<div class="poem">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="line">“Great Shakespeare’s ghost, the solemn strain to hear</div>
    <div class="line indentq">(Methinks I see the laurel’d shade appear!),</div>
    <div class="line indentq">Will hover o’er the scene, and wondering view</div>
    <div class="line indentq">His favourite Brutus rival’d thus by you.”</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">If one could suppose this to have been written in an ironic vein, the
lines would be satisfactorily pointed; but it is impossible, for Hughes
continues:</p>

<div class="poem">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="line">“Such Roman greatness in each action shines,</div>
    <div class="line indentq">Such Roman eloquence adorns your lines,</div>
    <div class="line indentq">That sure the Sibyl’s books this year foretold,</div>
    <div class="line indentq">And in some mystic leaf was found inroll’d,</div>
    <div class="line indentq">Rome, turn thy mournful eyes from Afric’s shore,</div>
    <div class="line indentq">Nor in her sands thy Cato’s tomb explore!</div>
    <div class="line indentq">When thrice six hundred times the circling sun</div>
    <div class="line indentq">His annual race shall through the zodiac run,</div>
    <div class="line indentq">An isle remote his monument shall rear,</div>
    <div class="line indentq">And every generous Briton pay a tear.”</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Or take the following by William Pattison, “To Mr. John Saunders,
occasioned by a sight of some of his paintings at Cambridge.” It would
be difficult to imagine a more incongruous bracketing of names than
that in the sixth line. The italics are my own:</p>

<div class="poem">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="line">“When Nature, from her unexhausted mine,</div>
    <div class="line indentq">Resolves to make some mighty science shine;</div>
    <div class="line indentq">Her embryo seeds inform the future birth,</div>
    <div class="line indentq">Improve the soul, and animate the earth;</div>
    <div class="line indentq">From thence, an Homer, or Apelles rise,</div>
    <div class="line indentq"><em>A Shakespeare, or a Saunders</em>, strike our eyes,</div>
    <div class="line indentq">And, lo! the promis’d wonder charms my view,</div>
    <div class="line indentq">The old Apelles rivall’d in the new!”</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="noindent"><!-- Page 24 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
One might quote pages of such stuff—torrents of heroic couplets—whose
very form, apart from their sentiment, show that Shakespeare was deemed
rather out of date. But the mention of his name counts for something.
It means that all of these poets felt, as Dr. Johnson felt, that though
they were not quite in sympathy with the old Elizabethan playwright, he
was still some one to be reckoned with. Indeed, every now and then the
truth comes out that he was too much for them. William Whitehead, for
one, had a full appreciation of him.</p>

<div class="poem">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="line">“O for a Shakespeare’s pencil, while I trace</div>
    <div class="line indentq">In nature’s breathing paint, the dreary waste</div>
    <div class="line indentq">Of Buxton”&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">he sighs in <cite>An Hymn to the Nymph of Bristol</cite>; and, for all the bathos
of its expression, the admiration is genuine.</p>

<p>William Hamilton wrote <cite>A Soliloquy in Imitation of Hamlet</cite>, a
paraphrase of the famous speech, almost as bald as that from which
Shakespeare copied his. But the effort is doubtless more of a literary
exercise than an attempt at improvement of the original, for Hamilton
shows at various points in his works a fairly intimate knowledge and
real regard for Shakespeare’s genius.</p>

<p>Mallet read his Shakespeare intelligently, as witness his <cite>Edwin and
Emma</cite>, a love ballad, with its text taken from <cite>Twelfth Night</cite>. And
William Shenstone shows the right spirit in this very passable stanza
from <cite>The Schoolmistress</cite>, happily describing a village school:</p>

<div class="poem">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="line">“Yet nurs’d with skill, what dazzling fruits appear!</div>
    <div class="line i1 indentq">Ev’n now sagacious foresight points to show</div>
    <div class="line indentq">A little bench of heedless bishops here,</div>
    <div class="line i1 indentq">And there a chancellor in embryo,</div>
    <div class="line i1 indentq"><!-- Page 25 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>Or bard sublime, if bard may e’er be so,</div>
    <div class="line indentq">As Milton, Shakespeare, names that ne’er shall die!</div>
    <div class="line i1 indentq">Though now he crawl along the ground so low,</div>
    <div class="line indentq">Nor weeting how the muse shall soar on high,</div>
    <div class="line indentq">Wishes, poor starveling elf! his paper kite to fly.”</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">That is well meaning and temperate enough, but some of these writers
erred on the side of enthusiasm. The following passage from Robert
Lloyd’s <cite>Shakespeare, an Epistle to Mr. Garrick</cite>, may be quoted as an
example:</p>

<div class="poem">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="line">“Oh, where’s the bard, who at one view</div>
    <div class="line indentq">Could look the whole creation through,</div>
    <div class="line indentq">Who travers’d all the human heart,</div>
    <div class="line indentq">Without recourse to Grecian art?</div>
    <div class="line indentq">He scorn’d the modes of imitation,</div>
    <div class="line indentq">Of altering, pilfering, and translation;</div>
    <div class="line indentq">Nor painted horror, grief, or rage,</div>
    <div class="line indentq">From models of a former age;</div>
    <div class="line indentq">The bright original he took,</div>
    <div class="line indentq">And tore the leaf from nature’s book.</div>
    <div class="line indentq">’Tis Shakespeare, thus, who stands alone.”</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>It will be noted that this effusion approaches Shakespeare through
Garrick; and such is the case with many others that must remain
unquoted. The reason is that Garrick occupied, by public consent if
not by his own desire, the position of Shakespeare’s patron. He took,
for instance, a leading part in organising the Shakespeare jubilee
at Stratford-on-Avon. Among his enterprises on this occasion was the
issue of a volume of tributes to Shakespeare, containing several
poetical pieces by himself, distinguished rather for their enthusiasm
than for poetical inspiration. Dr. Johnson opened the book with some
light verses, addressed to The Fair in a vein of somewhat elephantine
playfulness; and Garrick collected into it a number of extracts from
various writers, in verse and prose, <!-- Page 26 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>in praise of Shakespeare,
prefacing the whole with a high-flown effort of his own in heroic
couplets, and publishing it in handsome quarto.</p>

<p>In the garden of his house at Hampton, Garrick had a temple dedicated
to Shakespeare, and adorned with statuary, of which the chief piece, a
fine full-length figure by Roubiliac, is now in the entrance hall of
the British Museum. But to do him justice, his efforts, though they
carried the manner of the playhouse into private life, were conceived
in a spirit of genuine appreciation; and if many of his admirers
regarded him almost as the rescuer of Shakespeare from oblivion, he, at
any rate, was ready to acknowledge his indebtedness to the dramatist on
the presentation of whose characters his well-merited fame rested.</p>

<p>So much for the second period.<a name="FNanchor_26:1_5" id="FNanchor_26:1_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_26:1_5" class="fnanchor">[26:1]</a> Its literature is like a troubled
sea of conflicting opinion, through which the ship of Shakespeare’s
genius sails, tossed and buffeted by winds fair and foul, from all
points of the compass, and emerges triumphant.</p>

THE THIRD PERIOD</h3>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">In</span> the foregoing brief survey I have endeavoured to indicate in the
broadest manner possible the principal forces that affected the
opinions concerning Shakespeare held during the eighteenth century—the
chief boulders, so to say, round which the current of opinion swirled.
No such analysis seems necessary in dealing with the nineteenth
century. That is, comparatively speaking, smooth water. The poetic
reformation inaugurated by Wordsworth and Coleridge, who published
their <cite>Lyrical Ballads</cite> in 1798, practically effaced the classic
traditions of the previous hundred years, and prepared a way for the
school of æsthetic criticism which set Shakespeare in the place which
he now holds.</p>

<p>Æsthetic criticism, of a kind, was not entirely unknown. So far
back, for instance, as 1736, an anonymous pamphlet appeared with the
title, <cite>Some Remarks on the Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark</cite>.
The author is an enthusiastic admirer of “the greatest tragic writer
that ever lived (except Sophocles and Euripides),” though most of the
beauties which he points out would be obvious to a reader of average
intelligence, and his expositions lack insight. Such efforts were, in
fact, nothing more than academic recreation, and but for their evidence
of a right tendency are hardly worthy of mention. In effect they were,
of course, immeasurably distant from the work of the <!-- Page 28 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>æsthetic critics
of the early nineteenth century. Coleridge spoke truly when he thus
described his achievement:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“However inferior in ability I may be to some who have followed
me, I own I am proud that I was the first in time who publicly
demonstrated to the full extent of the position, that the
supposed irregularity and extravagances of Shakespeare were the
mere dreams of a pedantry that arraigned the eagle because it
had not the dimensions of the swan.”<a name="FNanchor_28:1_6" id="FNanchor_28:1_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_28:1_6" class="fnanchor">[28:1]</a></p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">One has but to mention Hazlitt as Coleridge’s co-worker to feel that
Shakespeare’s position can never be seriously called in question.</p>

<p>In the mass of literature, much of it excellent, that has sprung from
this beginning, two works only—in English prose—are so pre-eminent as
to demand mention here, Mr. Swinburne’s <cite>Study of Shakespeare</cite> (1880),
and Professor Dowden’s <cite>Shakespeare, his Mind and Art</cite> (1874). Of
these, Mr. Swinburne’s book astounds one with a flow of eulogistic
rhetoric that can only be compared with the marvellous piece of
inspired enthusiasm on the same subject by Victor Hugo.</p>

<p>In nineteenth century verse Shakespeare’s name appears comparatively
seldom, excepting in poems written directly in his honour. This is a
logical result of the change from the poetic manner of the eighteenth
century, and the abandonment of the poetry of direct didacticism.
The characteristic poetry of the nineteenth century was as different
from that of the eighteenth century as the pictures of Turner were
from those of the English pre-Raphaelites. <!-- Page 29 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>That is to say, the
typical poetry of the earlier age was marked by a clean symmetry, a
clearness of imagery, and a sharpness of detail paralleled in some
degree by the pictures of the pre-Raphaelites; whereas the poetry of
the nineteenth century leaned more to imaginative embroidery, and
what one may call, perhaps, the indefiniteness occasioned by artistic
introspection. It was, in fact, very much in the nature of a change
from a public oration to a private soliloquy. Even the mention, in
nineteenth century poetry, of a great man’s name to typify in a measure
the greatness of his country, is unusual. In Wordsworth’s sonnet, “It
is not to be thought of,” for example, the names of Shakespeare and
Milton come as something of a surprise from the poet who did most to
introduce the nineteenth century school of poetry. It is curious to
note that here the poet unconsciously imitates the manner of the verse
from which he deemed it his mission to effect a change; this sonnet
is, indeed, curiously typical of the period of poetic reformation in
which it was composed; for, though it belongs distinctly to the new
school, it possesses in the references to Shakespeare and Milton one
of the prominent characteristics of eighteenth century poetry. Thus,
though the poetry of the third period contains poems of the highest
order in direct praise of Shakespeare, as witness the sonnets of Mr.
Swinburne and Matthew Arnold, it is apparent that the anthologist
will find the greater part of his material in the works of prose
writers. At first glance one is bewildered by the mass of literature
which presents itself, but the scheme of this collection goes a small
way towards simplifying the choice. Pieces dealing with particular
merits of Shakespeare have generally been rejected, so that studies
<!-- Page 30 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>of characters in the plays find no place. Similarly, studies, such,
for example, as De Quincey’s fine psychological analysis of the
knocking at the gate in <cite>Macbeth</cite>, have been excluded. Still, even
with these limitations, one feels that the task of selection is
beset with dangers. Every reader of Shakespearean literature has his
favourite passages, and though I have endeavoured to judge with a just
catholicity, I present the result of my labours in all meekness.</p>


<h3><abbr title="Six">VI</abbr><br />

SCHEME OF THE BOOK</h3>

<p>The extracts have been arranged in three divisions. The first, which is
subdivided into three periods, corresponding with those described in
the foregoing notes, contains pieces in direct praise of Shakespeare.</p>

<p>The second part of the work contains brief passages in prose and verse
similar in character to those in the first part, but selected either
for their epigrammatic terseness or for their crystallisation of a fine
thought that is conveniently detachable from its context.</p>

<p>The third part is devoted to pieces which treat Shakespeare or his
works from a romantic standpoint. The devotion of only a small space to
this section was inevitable, and I regret the number of omissions. One
especially must be mentioned. Landor’s witty <cite>Citation and Examination
of William Shakespeare</cite> on the charge of deer stealing, represents
exactly the kind of piece which <!-- Page 31 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>I aimed at including. It is, however,
far too long to quote in full, and the interest is so deftly carried
throughout that I have found it quite impossible to select any portion
which could stand intelligibly by itself. I should have liked, also,
to include Browning’s poem, <cite>At the Mermaid</cite>, but here the question of
copyright intervened.</p>

<p>The dates immediately following the authors’ names show (sometimes
approximately) the earliest years with which the pieces quoted can be
definitely associated. Occasionally they mark the year in which the
piece was written, but in the majority of cases the year is that of
publication.</p>

<p>My best thanks are due to the following authors and publishers, who
have kindly given me permission to use copyright pieces:—Mr. <abbr title="Algernon Charles">A.
C.</abbr> Swinburne, Mr. <abbr title="William Michael">W. M.</abbr> Rossetti, Mr. Gerald Massey, Mr. Theodore
Watts-Dunton, Mr. William Watson, Mr. Richard Watson Gilder, Mr. <abbr title="William Schwenck">W.

Son (John Ruskin), <abbr title="Misters">Messrs.</abbr> Smith Elder <abbr title="and Company">&amp; Co.</abbr> (Robert Browning).</p>

<p>Finally, it is my pleasant duty to record my deep indebtedness to Mr.
Sidney Lee, at whose suggestion this book was undertaken.</p>

sweet witty soul of Ovid lives in mellifluous and honey-tongued
Shakespeare, witness his “Venus and Adonis,” his “Lucrece,” his sugared
sonnets among his private friends, etc.</p>

<p>As Plautus and Seneca are accounted the best for Comedy and Tragedy
among the Latins, so Shakespeare among the English is the most
excellent in both kinds for the stage; for Comedy, witness his
“Gentlemen of Verona,” his “Errors,” his “Love’s Labour’s Lost,”
his “Love’s Labour’s Wonne,” his “Midsummer Night’s Dream,” and his
“Merchant of Venice”; for Tragedy, his “Richard the <abbr title="Second">2</abbr>,” “Richard the
<abbr title="Third">3</abbr>,” “Henry the <abbr title="Fourth">4</abbr>,” “King John,” “Titus Andronicus,” and his “Romeo and
Juliet.”</p>

<p>As Epius Stolo said that the Muses would speak with Plautus’ tongue,
if they would speak Latin; so I say that the Muses would speak with
Shakespeare’s fine filed phrase, if they would speak English.</p>

learning, and ignorance of the ancients, told him at last, “That if
Mr. Shakespeare had not read the ancients, he had likewise not stolen
anything from ’em [a fault the other made no conscience of]; and that
if he would produce any one topic finely treated by any of them, he
would undertake to show something upon the same subject at least as
well written by Shakespeare.”</p>

<h4>THOMAS FULLER, <abbr title="circa"><i>c.</i></abbr> 1661<br />

(1608-1661)</h4>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">He</span> was an eminent instance of the truth of that rule, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Poeta non fit
sed nascitur</i>; one is not <em>made</em>, but <em>born</em> a poet. Indeed, his
learning was very little, so that, as Cornish diamonds are not polished
by any lapidary, but are pointed and smoothed even as they are taken
out of the earth, so nature itself was all the <em>art</em> which was used
upon him.</p>

<p>Many were the wit-combats betwixt him and Ben Jonson; which two I
behold like a Spanish great galleon and an English man of war: Master
Jonson (like the former) was built far higher in learning; solid, but
slow in his performances. Shakespeare, with the English man of war,
lesser in bulk, but lighter in sailing, could turn with all tides, tack
about, and take advantage of all winds, by the quickness of his wit and
invention.</p>

<h4>SAMUEL PEPYS, 1662-1667<br />

(1633-1703)</h4>

<p class="noindent">1661-1662. March <abbr title="first">1st</abbr>. My wife and I by coach, first to see my little
picture that is a-drawing, and thence to the Opera, and there saw
“Romeo and Juliet,” the first time it was ever acted, but it is a play
of itself the worst that ever I heard, and the worst acts that ever I
saw these people do, and I am resolved to go no more to see the first
time of acting, for they were all of them out more or less.</p>

<p>1662. September 29th. To the King’s Theatre, where we saw “Midsummer
Night’s Dream,” which I had never seen before, nor ever shall again,
for it is the most insipid, ridiculous play that ever I saw in my life.</p>

<p>1666. December 28th. To the Duke’s House, and there saw “Macbeth” most
excellently acted, and a most excellent play for variety. I had sent my
wife to meet me there, who did come: so I did go to White Hall, and got
my Lord Bellassis to get me into the playhouse; and there, after all
staying above an hour for the players, the King and all waiting, which
was absurd, saw “Henry the Fifth” well done by the Duke’s people, and
in most excellent habit, all new vests, being put on but this night.
But I sat so high and far off, that I missed most of the words, and sat
with a wind coming into my back and neck, which did much trouble me.
The play continued till twelve at night; and then up, and a most horrid
cold night it was, and frosty, and moonshine.</p>

<p><!-- Page 63 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>1666-67. January 7th. To the Duke’s House, and saw “Macbeth,” which,
though I saw it lately, yet appears a most excellent play in all
respects, but especially in divertisement, though it be a deep tragedy;
which is a strange perfection in a tragedy, it being most proper here,
and suitable.</p>

<p>1667. October 16th. To the Duke of York’s House; and I was vexed to
see Young, who is but a bad actor at best, act Macbeth, in the room
of Betterton, who, poor man! is sick: but, Lord! what a prejudice it
wrought in me against the whole play, and everybody else agreed in
disliking this fellow. Thence home, and there find my wife gone home;
because of this fellow’s acting of the part, she went out of the house
again.</p>

<h4>MARGARET CAVENDISH, DUCHESS OF NEWCASTLE, 1664<br />

(1624?-1674)</h4>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">I wonder</span> how that person you mention in your letter could either have
the conscience, or confidence to dispraise Shakespeare’s plays, as
to say they were made up only with clowns, fools, watchmen, and the
like; but to answer that person, though Shakespeare’s wit will answer
for himself, I say, that it seems by his judging, or censuring, he
understands not plays, or wit; for to express properly, rightly,
usually, and naturally, a clown’s, or fool’s humour, expressions,
phrases, garbs, manners, actions, words, and course of life, is as
witty, wise, judicious, ingenious, and observing, as to write and
express the expressions, phrases, garbs, manners, actions, words, and
course of life, of kings and princes; and to express naturally, to
the life, a mean country wench, as a great lady; a courtesan, as a
chaste woman; a mad man, as a man in his right reason and senses; a
drunkard, as a sober man; a knave, as an honest man; and so a clown,
as a well-bred man; and a fool, as a wise man; nay, it expresses
and declares a greater wit, to express, and deliver to posterity,
the extravagances of madness, the subtlety of knaves, the ignorance
of clowns, and the simplicity of naturals, or the craft of feigned
fools, than to express regularities, plain honesty, courtly garbs,
or sensible discourses, for ’tis harder to express nonsense than
sense, and ordinary conversations, than that which is unusual; and
’tis harder, and requires more wit to express <!-- Page 65 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>a jester, than a grave
statesman; yet Shakespeare did not want wit to express to the life all
sorts of persons, of what quality, profession, degree, breeding, or
birth soever; nor did he want wit to express the divers and different
humours, or natures or several passions in mankind; and so well he hath
expressed in his plays all sorts of persons, as one would think he had
been transformed into every one of those persons he hath described.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
Who could not swear he had been a noble lover, that could woo so
well? and there is not any person he had described in his book, but
his readers might think they were well acquainted with them; indeed,
Shakespeare had a clear judgment, a quick wit, a spreading fancy, a
subtle observation, a deep apprehension, and a most eloquent elocution;
truly he was a natural orator, as well as a natural poet, and he was
not an orator to speak well only on some subjects, as lawyers, who can
make eloquent orations at the bar, and plead subtly and wittily in
law-cases, or divines, that can preach eloquent sermons, or dispute
subtly and wittily in theology, but take them from that, and put them
to other subjects, and they will be to seek; but Shakespeare’s wit and
eloquence was general, for and upon all subjects, he rather wanted
subjects for his wit and eloquence to work on, for which he was forced
to take some of his plots out of history, where he only took the bare
designs, the wit and language being all his own.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">To</span> begin, then, with Shakespeare; he was the man who of all modern, and
perhaps ancient poets, had the largest and most comprehensive soul. All
the images of nature were still present to him, and he drew them not
laboriously, but luckily: when he describes any thing, you more than
see it, you feel it too. Those who accuse him to have wanted learning,
give him the greater commendation: he was naturally learned; he needed
not the spectacles of books to read Nature; he looked inwards, and
found her there. I cannot say he is everywhere alike; were he so, I
should do him injury to compare him with the greatest of mankind. He is
many times flat, insipid; his comic wit degenerating into clenches, his
serious swelling into bombast. But he is always great, when some great
occasion is presented to him; no man can say he ever had a fit subject
for his wit, and did not then raise himself as high above the rest of
poets,</p>

<p>But the times were ignorant in which they lived. Poetry was
then, if not in its infancy among us, at least not arrived to
its vigour and maturity. Witness the lameness of their plots;
many of which, especially those which they writ first (for even
that age refined itself in some measure), were made up of some
ridiculous incoherent story, which in one play many times took
up the business of an age. I suppose I need not name “Pericles,
Prince of Tyre,” nor the historical plays of Shakespeare;
besides many of the rest, as the “Winter’s Tale,” “Love’s
Labour’s Lost,” “Measure for Measure,” which were either
grounded on impossibilities, or at least so meanly written that
the comedy neither caused your mirth, nor the serious part your
concernment.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">The</span> play of “The London Cuckolds” was acted this evening before a
suitable audience, who were extremely well diverted with that heap of
vice and absurdity. The indignation which Eugenio, who is a gentleman
of just taste, has, upon occasion of seeing human nature fall so low
in their delights, made him, I thought, expatiate upon the mention
of this play very agreeably. “Of all men living,” said he, “I pity
players (who must be men of good understanding to be capable of being
such) that they are obliged to repeat and assume proper gestures for
representing things, of which their reason must be ashamed, and which
they must disdain their audience for approving. The amendment of
these low gratifications is only to be made by people of condition,
by encouraging the presentation of the noble characters drawn by
Shakespeare and others, from whence it is impossible to return without
strong impressions of honour and humanity. On these occasions distress
is laid before us with all its causes and <!-- Page 77 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>consequences, and our
resentment placed according to the merit of the persons afflicted. Were

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">The</span> delicacy of his taste, and the natural bent of his own genius
(equal, if not superior, to some of the best of theirs [the ancients]),
would certainly have led him to read and study them with so much
pleasure, that some of their fine images would naturally have
insinuated themselves into, and been mixed with his own writings; so
that his not copying at least something from them, may be an argument
of his never having read them. Whether his ignorance of the ancients
were a disadvantage to him or no, may admit of a dispute: for though
the knowledge of them might have made him more correct, yet it is not
improbable but that the regularity and deference for them, which would
have attended that correctness, might have restrained some of that
fire, impetuosity, and even beautiful extravagance, which we admire in
Shakespeare: and I believe we were better pleased with those thoughts,
altogether new and uncommon, which his own imagination supplied him so
abundantly with, than if he had given us the most beautiful passages
out of the Greek and Latin poets, and that in the most agreeable manner

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">Shakespeare</span> was one of the greatest geniuses that the world e’er saw
for the Tragic Stage. Though he lay under greater disadvantages than
any of his successors, yet had he greater and more genuine beauties
than the best and greatest of them. And what makes the brightest glory
of his character, those beauties were entirely his own, and owing to
the force of his own nature; whereas his faults were owing to his
education, and to the age that he lived in. One may say of him as they
did of Homer, that he had none to imitate, and is himself inimitable.</p>

<h4>JOSEPH ADDISON, 1714<br />

(1672-1719)</h4>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">Our</span> critics do not seem sensible that there is more beauty in the works
of a great genius who is ignorant of the rules of art, than in those
of a little genius who knows and observes them. It is of these men
of genius that Terence speaks in opposition to the little artificial
cavillers of his time:</p>

<div class="poem">
  <div class="stanza italic">
    <div class="line">Quorum æmulari exoptat negligentiam</div>
    <div class="line">Potius quam istorum obscuram diligentiam.</div>

</div>

<p class="noindent">A critic may have the same consolation in the ill success of his play,
as Dr. South tells us a physician has at the death of a patient,
that he was killed <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">secundum artem</i>. Our inimitable Shakespeare is a
stumbling-block to the whole tribe of these rigid critics. Who would
not rather read one of his plays, where there is not a single rule of
the stage observed, than any production of a modern critic, where there
is not one of them violated? Shakespeare was indeed born with all the
seeds of poetry, and may be compared to the stone in Pyrrhus’s ring,
which, as Pliny tells us, had the figure of Apollo and the nine Muses
in the veins of it, produced by the spontaneous hand of Nature, without
any help from art.</p>

<h4>ALEXANDER POPE, 1725<br />

(1688-1744)</h4>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">If</span> ever any author deserved the name of an <em>Original</em>, it was
Shakespeare. Homer himself drew not his art so immediately from the
fountains of Nature; it proceeded through Egyptian strainers and
channels, and came to him not without some tincture of the learning, or
some cast of the models, of those before him. The poetry of Shakespeare
was inspiration indeed; he is not so much an imitator as an instrument
of Nature: and it is not so just to say that he speaks from her, as
that she speaks through him.</p>

<p>His <em>characters</em> are so much Nature herself, that ’tis a sort of injury
to call them by so distant a name as copies of her. Those of other
poets have a constant resemblance, which shows that they received them
from one another, and were but multipliers of the same image; each
picture, like a mock rainbow, is but the reflection of a reflection.
But every single character in Shakespeare is as much an individual as
those in life itself; it is as impossible to find any two alike; as
such as from their relation or affinity in any respect appear most to
be twins, will upon comparison be found remarkably distinct. To this
life and variety of character we must add the wonderful preservation of
it, which is such throughout his Plays, that, had all the speeches been
printed without the very names of the persons, I believe one might have
applied them with certainty to every speaker.</p>

<p>The power over our passions was never possessed in a more eminent
degree, or displayed in so different instances. Yet all along there is
seen no labour, no pains to raise <!-- Page 86 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>them; no preparation to guide our
guess to the effect, or be perceiv’d to lead toward it; but the heart
swells, and the tears burst out, just at the proper places. We are
surprised the moment we weep; and yet upon reflection find the passion
so just, that we should be surprised if we had not wept, and wept at
that very moment.</p>

<p>How astonishing is it, again, that the passions directly opposite to
these, laughter and spleen, are no less at his command! that he is not
more a master of the <em>great</em> than of the <em>ridiculous</em> in human nature;
of our noblest tendernesses, than of our vainest foibles; of our
strongest emotions, than of our idlest sensations!</p>

<p>Nor does he only excel in the passions: in the coolness of reflection
and reasoning he is full as admirable. His <em>sentiments</em> are not only
in general the most pertinent and judicious upon every subject; but by
a talent very peculiar, something between penetration and felicity,
he hits upon that particular point on which the bent of each argument
turns, or the force of each motive depends. This is perfectly amazing,
from a man of no education or experience in those great and public
scenes of life which are usually the subject of his thoughts: so that
he seems to have known the world by intuition, to have looked through
human nature at one glance, and to be the only author that gives ground
for a very new opinion: That the philosopher, and even the man of the
world, may be <em>born</em>, as well as the poet.</p>

<p>It must be owned that with all these great excellencies, he has almost
as great defects; and that as he has certainly written better, so he
has perhaps written worse, than any other. But I think I can in some
measure account for these defects, from several causes and accidents;
without which it <!-- Page 87 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>is hard to imagine that so large and so enlightened
a mind could ever have been susceptible of them. That all these
contingencies should unite to his disadvantage seems to me almost as
singularly unlucky, as that so many various (nay contrary) talents
should meet in one man, was happy and extraordinary.</p>

<p>I will conclude by saying of Shakespeare, that with all his faults,
and with all the irregularity of his <em>drama</em>, one may look upon his
works in comparison of those that are more finished and regular, as
upon an ancient majestic piece of Gothic architecture compared with a
neat modern building; the latter is more elegant and glaring, but the
former is more strong and more solemn. It must be allowed, that in one
of these there are materials enough to make many of the other. It has
much the greater variety, and much the nobler apartments; though we are
often conducted to them by dark, odd, and uncouth passages. Nor does
the whole fail to strike us with greater reverence, though many of the
parts are childish, ill-placed, and unequal to its grandeur.</p>

<p class="source">Preface to <cite>The Works of Shakespeare</cite>. 1725.</p>

<div class="bqsmall">
<a name="Notepg87" id="Notepg87"></a><p>De Quincey in his essay on Pope says of this preface: “For the
edition we have little to plead; but for the editor it is but
just to make three apologies. In the <em>first</em> place he wrote a
brilliant preface, which, although (like other works of the
same class) too much occupied in displaying his own ability,
and too often, for the sake of an effective antithesis, doing
deep injustice to Shakespeare, yet undoubtedly, as a whole,
extended his fame, by giving the sanction and countersign of
a great wit to the national admiration. <em>Secondly</em>, as Dr.
Johnson admits, Pope’s failure pointed out the right road to
his successors. <em>Thirdly</em>, even in this failure it is but fair
to say, that in a graduated scale of merit, as distributed
amongst the long succession of editors through that century,
Pope holds a rank proportionable to his age. For the year 1720,
he is no otherwise below Theobald, Hanmer, Capell, Warburton,
or even Johnson, than as they are successively below each
other, and all of them as to accuracy below Steevens, as he
again was below Malone and Reed.”</p>

let us into the knowledge of our nature. Others may exercise the reason
or amuse the imagination; but these only can improve the heart, and
form the human mind to wisdom. Now, in this science, our Shakespeare is
confessed to occupy the foremost place; whether we consider the amazing
sagacity with which he investigates every hidden spring and wheel of
human action; or his happy manner of communicating this knowledge,
in the just and living paintings which he has given us of all our
passions, appetites, and pursuits. These afford a lesson which can
never be too often repeated, or too constantly inculcated.</p>

<h4>DAVID HUME, 1754.<br />

(1711-1774)</h4>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">If</span> Shakespeare be considered as a <strong>Man</strong>, born in a rude age, and
educated in the lowest manner, without any instruction, either from the
world or from books, he may be regarded as a prodigy. If represented
as a <strong>Poet</strong>, capable of furnishing a proper entertainment to a
refined or intelligent audience, we must abate much of this eulogy.
In his compositions, we regret, that many irregularities, and even
absurdities, should so frequently disfigure the animated and passionate
scenes intermixed with them; and at the same time, we perhaps admire
the more those beauties, on account of their being surrounded with
such deformities. A striking peculiarity of sentiment, adapted to a
single character, he frequently hits, as it were, by inspiration; but a
reasonable propriety of thought he cannot for any time uphold. Nervous
and picturesque expressions as well as descriptions abound in him; but
it is in vain we look either for purity or simplicity of diction. His
total ignorance of all theatrical art and conduct, however material a
defect, yet, as it affects the spectator rather than the reader, we can
more easily excuse, than that want of taste which often prevails in his
productions, and which gives way only by intervals to the irradiations
of genius. A great and fertile genius he certainly possessed, and one
enriched equally with a tragic and comic vein; but he ought to be cited
as a proof, how dangerous it is to rely on these advantages alone for
attaining an excellence in the finer arts. And <!-- Page 98 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>there may even remain a
suspicion, that we over-rate, if possible, the greatness of his genius;
in the same manner as bodies often appear more gigantic, on account
of their being disproportioned and misshapen. He died in 1616, aged
fifty-three years.</p>

<p>Jonson possessed all the learning which was wanting to Shakespeare,
and wanted all the genius of which the other was possessed. Both of
them were equally deficient in taste and elegance, in harmony and
correctness. A servile copyist of the ancients, Jonson translated into
bad English the beautiful passages of the Greek and Roman authors,
without accommodating to the manners of his age and country. His merit
has been totally eclipsed by that of Shakespeare, whose rude genius
prevailed over the rude art of his contemporary. The English theatre
has ever since taken a strong tincture of Shakespeare’s spirit and
character; and thence it has proceeded, that the nation has undergone
from all its neighbours the reproach of barbarism, from which its
valuable productions in some parts of learning would otherwise have
exempted it.</p>

<h4>JOHN ARMSTRONG, 1758<br />

(1709-1779)</h4>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">Shakespeare</span>, who I will venture to say had the most musical ear of
all the English poets, is abundantly irregular in his versification:
but his wildest licences seldom hurt the ear; on the contrary, they
give his verse a spirit and variety, which prevent its ever cloying.
Our modern tragedy-writers, instead of using the advantages of their
own languages, seem in general to imitate the monotony of the French
versification: and the only licence they ever venture upon, is that
poor tame one the supernumerary syllable at the end of a line; which
they are apt to manage in such a manner as to give their verse a most
ungraceful halt. But it is not want of ear alone which makes our common
manufacturers of tragedy so insipidly solemn and so void of harmony: it
is want of feeling.</p>

<p class="section">Shakespeare, indeed, without one perfect plan, has perhaps excelled all
other dramatic poets as to detached scenes. But he was a wonder!—His
deep knowledge of human nature, his prodigious variety of fancy and
invention, and of characters drawn with the strongest, truest, and most
exquisite strokes, oblige you to forget his most violent irregularities.</p>

<h4>SAMUEL JOHNSON, 1765<br />

(1709-1784)</h4>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">The</span> work of a correct and regular writer is a garden accurately formed
and diligently planted, varied with shades, and scented with flowers;
the composition of Shakespeare is a forest, in which oaks extend their
branches, and pines tower in the air, interspersed sometimes with weeds
and brambles, and sometimes giving shelter to myrtles and to roses;
filling the eye with awful pomp, and gratifying the mind with endless
diversity. Other poets display cabinets of precious rarities, minutely
finished, wrought into shape, and polished into brightness. Shakespeare
opens a mine which contains gold and diamonds in unexhaustible plenty,
though clouded by incrustations, debased by impurities, and mingled
with a mass of meaner minerals.</p>

<div class="bqsmall">
<p>In <cite>The Rambler</cite>, <abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 156 (14 <abbr title="September">Sept.</abbr> 1751), Johnson wrote:
“Instead of vindicating tragi-comedy by the success of
Shakespeare, we ought perhaps to pay new honours to that
transcendent and unbounded genius that could preside over the
passions in sport; who, to actuate the affections, needed
not the slow gradation of common means, but could fill the
heart with instantaneous jollity or sorrow, and vary our
disposition as he changed his scenes. Perhaps the effects even
of Shakespeare’s poetry might have been greater, had he not
counteracted himself; and we might have been more interested
in the distresses of his heroes, had we not been so frequently
diverted by the jokes of his buffoons.”</p>

<h4>WILLIAM RICHARDSON, 1774<br />

(1743-1814)</h4>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">No</span> writer has hitherto appeared who possesses in a more eminent degree
than Shakespeare, the power of imitating the passions. All of them seem
familiar to him; the boisterous no less than the gentle; the benign no
less than the malignant. There are several writers, as there are many
players, who are successful in imitating some particular passions,
but who appear stiff, awkward, and unnatural, in the expression of
others. Some are capable of exhibiting very striking representations
of resolute and intrepid natures, but cannot so easily bend themselves
to those that are softer and more complacent. Others, again, seem full
of amiable affection and tenderness, but cannot exalt themselves to
the boldness of the hero, or magnanimity of the patriot. The genius
of Shakespeare is unlimited. Possessing extreme sensibility, and
uncommonly susceptible, he is the Proteus of the drama; he changes
himself into every character, and enters easily into every condition of
human nature.</p>

<hr class="thoughtbreak" />

<p>Many dramatic writers of different ages are capable, occasionally, of
breaking out, with great fervour of genius, in the natural language
of strong emotion. No writer of antiquity is more distinguished for
abilities of this kind than Euripides. His whole heart and soul seem
torn and agitated by the force of the passion he imitates. He ceases
to be Euripides; he is Medea; he is Orestes. Shakespeare, <!-- Page 118 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>however, is
most eminently distinguished, not only by these occasional sallies, but
by imitating the passion in all its aspects, by pursuing it through
all its windings and labyrinths, by moderating or accelerating its
impetuosity according to the influence of other principles and of
external events, and finally by combining it in a judicious manner with
other passions and propensities, or by setting it aptly in opposition.
He thus unites the two essential powers of dramatic invention, that of
forming characters; and that of imitating in their natural expressions,
the passions and affections of which they are composed.</p>

<h4>SIR WALTER SCOTT, 1814<br />

(1771-1832)</h4>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">The</span> English stage might be considered as equally without rule and
without model when Shakespeare arose. The effect of the genius of an
individual upon the taste of a nation is mighty; but that genius, in
its turn, is formed according to the opinions prevalent at the period
when it comes into existence. Such was the case with Shakespeare. With
an education more extensive, and a taste refined by the classical
models, it is probable that he also, in admiration of the ancient
drama, might have mistaken the form for the essence, and subscribed to
those rules which had produced such masterpieces of art. Fortunately
for the full exertion of a genius as comprehensive and versatile,
as intense and powerful, Shakespeare had no access to any models of
which the commanding merit might have controlled and limited his own
exertions. He followed the path which a nameless crowd of obscure
writers had trodden before him; but he moved in it with the grace and
majestic step of a being of a superior order, and vindicated for ever
the British theatre from a pedantic restriction to classical rule.
Nothing went before Shakespeare which in any respect was fit to fix
and stamp the character of a national drama; and certainly no one will
succeed him, capable of establishing by mere authority, a form more
restricted than that which Shakespeare used.</p>

<h4>SAMUEL TAYLOR COLERIDGE, 1817<br />

(1772-1834)</h4>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">No</span> man was ever yet a great poet, without being at the same time a
profound philosopher. For poetry is the blossom and the fragrancy
of all human knowledge, human thoughts, human passions, emotions,
language. In Shakespeare’s <strong>Poems</strong>, the creative power, and the
intellectual energy, wrestle as in a war embrace. Each in its excess
of strength seems to threaten the extinction of the other. At length
in the <strong>Drama</strong> they were reconciled, and fought each with its
shield before the breast of the other. Or, like two rapid streams, that
at their first meeting within narrow and rocky banks, mutually strive
to repel each other, and intermix reluctantly and in tumult; but soon
finding a wider channel and more yielding shores, blend, and dilate,
and flow on in one current and with one voice. The “Venus and Adonis”
did not, perhaps, allow the display of the deeper passions. But the
story of Lucretia seems to favour, and even demand their intensest
workings. And yet we find in <em>Shakespeare’s</em> management of the tale,
neither pathos, nor any other <em>dramatic</em> quality. There is the same
minute and faithful imagery as in the former poem, in the same vivid
colours, inspirited by the same impetuous vigour of thought, and
diverging and contracting with the same activity of the assimilative
and of the modifying faculties; and with a yet larger display, a
yet wider range of knowledge and reflection; and, lastly, with the
same perfect dominion, often <em>domination</em>, over the whole <!-- Page 131 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>world of
language. What then shall we say? even this: that—</p>

<p>Shakespeare, no mere child of nature; no automaton of genius; no
passive vehicle of inspiration possessed by the spirit, not possessing
it; first studied patiently, meditated deeply, understood minutely,
till knowledge, become habitual and intuitive, wedded itself to his
habitual feelings, and at length gave birth to that stupendous power,
by which he stands alone, with no equal or second in his own class; to
that power, which seated him on one of the two glory-smitten summits
of the poetic mountain, with Milton as his compeer, not rival. While
the former darts himself forth, and passes into all the forms of human
character and passion, to one Proteus of the fire and the flood; the
other attracts all forms and things to himself, in the unity of his own
<strong>Ideal</strong>. All things and modes of action shape themselves anew in
the being of <strong>Milton</strong>; while <strong>Shakespeare</strong> becomes all
things, yet for ever remaining himself. O what great men hast thou not
produced, England! my country!</p>

Henry Nelson Coleridge, 1867, <abbr title ="two, pages">ii. pp.</abbr> 68-69:—I greatly dislike
beauties and selections in general; but as proof positive of
his unrivalled excellence, I should like to try Shakespeare
by this criterion. Make out your amplest catalogue of all the
human faculties, as reason or the moral law, the will, the
feeling of the coincidence of the two (a feeling <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sui generis

the understanding or prudence, wit, fancy, imagination,
judgment,—and then of the objects on which these are to be
employed, as the beauties, the terrors, and the seeming
caprices of nature, the realities and the capabilities, that
is, the actual and the ideal, of the human mind, conceived
as an individual or as a social being, as in innocence or in
guilt, in a play-paradise, or in a war-field of temptation;
and then compare with Shakespeare under each of these heads
all or any of the writers in prose and verse that have ever
lived! Who, that is <!-- Page 132 --><span class="pagenum"  style="font-size: 95%;"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>competent to judge, doubts the result? And

of that wretched sciolist, whom Frenchmen, to their shame,
have honoured before their elder and better worthies,—but

reverently, does God choose idiots by whom to convey divine
truths to man?</p>

<h4>FRANCIS LORD JEFFREY, 1817<br />

(1773-1850)</h4>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">More</span> full of wisdom and ridicule and sagacity, than all the moralists
and satirists that ever existed—he [Shakespeare] is more wild, airy and
inventive, and more pathetic and fantastic, than all the poets of all
regions and ages of the world:—and has all those elements so happily
mixed up in him, and bears his high faculties so temperately, that
the most severe reader cannot complain of him for want of strength or
of reason—nor the most sensitive for defect of ornament or ingenuity.
Every thing in him is in unmeasured abundance, and unequalled
perfection—but everything so balanced and kept in subordination, as not
to jostle or disturb or take the place of another. The most exquisite
poetical conceptions, images, and descriptions are given with such
brevity, and introduced with such skill, as merely to adorn, without
loading the sense they accompany. Although his sails are purple and
perfumed, and his prow of beaten gold, they waft him on his voyage,
not less, but more rapidly and directly than if they had been composed
of baser materials. All his excellences, like those of Nature herself,
are thrown out together; and instead of interfering with, support and
recommend each other. His flowers are not tied up in garlands, nor his
fruits crushed into baskets—but spring living from the soil, in all the
dew and freshness of youth; while the graceful foliage in which they
lurk, and the ample branches, the <!-- Page 134 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>rough and vigorous stem, and the
wide-spreading roots on which they depend, are present along with them,
and share, in their places, the equal care of their Creator.</p>

<h4>WILLIAM HAZLITT, 1818<br />

(1778-1830)</h4>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">The</span> striking peculiarity of Shakespeare’s mind was its generic quality,
its power of communication with all other minds—so that it contained a
universe of thought and feeling within itself, and had no one peculiar
bias, or exclusive excellence more than another. He was just like any
other man, but that he was like all other men. He was the least of an
egotist that it was possible to be. He was nothing in himself; but
he was all that others were, or that they could become. He not only
had in himself the germs of every faculty and feeling, but he could
follow them by anticipation, intuitively, into all their conceivable
ramifications, through every change of fortune or conflict of passion,
or turn of thought. He had “a mind reflecting ages past,” and
present:—All the people that ever lived are there. There was no respect
of persons with him. His genius alone shone equally on the evil and on
the good, on the wise and the foolish, the monarch and the beggar: “All
corners of the earth, kings, queens, and states, maids, matrons, nay,
the secrets of the grave,” are hardly hid from his searching glance.
He was like the genius of humanity, changing places with all of us at
pleasure, and playing with our purposes as with his own. He turned the
globe round for his amusement, and surveyed the generations of men,
and the individuals as they passed, with their different concerns,
passions, follies, vices, virtues, actions, and motives—as well those
that they knew, as those <!-- Page 136 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>which they did not know, or acknowledge to
themselves. The dreams of childhood, the ravings of despair, were the
toys of his fancy. Airy beings waited at his call, and came at his
bidding. Harmless fairies nodded to him, and did him curtesies: and the
night-hag bestrode the blast at the command of “his so potent art.”
The world of spirits lay open to him, like the world of real men and
women: and there is the same truth in his delineations of the one as
of the other; for if the preternatural characters he describes could
be supposed to exist, they would speak, and feel, and act, as he makes
them. He had only to think of any thing in order to become that thing,
with all the circumstances belonging to it. When he conceived of a
character, whether real or imaginary, he not only entered into all its
thoughts and feelings, but seemed instantly, and as if by touching a
secret spring, to be surrounded with all the same objects, “subject to
the same skyey influences,” the same local, outward, and unforeseen
accidents which would occur in reality.</p>

<hr class="thoughtbreak" />

<p>The following occurs in Hazlitt’s essay “On Dryden and Pope”
(<abbr title="ibidem, pages"><i>ib.</i>, pp.</abbr> 137-38):—The poet of nature is one who, from
the elements of beauty, of power, and of passion in his own
breast, sympathises with whatever is beautiful, and grand, and
impassioned in nature, in its simple majesty, in its immediate
appeal to the senses, to the thoughts and hearts of all men; so
that the poet of nature, by the truth, and depth, and harmony
of his mind, may be said to hold communion with the very soul
of nature; to be identified with and to foreknow and to record
the feelings of all men at all times and places, as they are
liable to the same impressions; and to exert the same power
over the minds of his readers, that nature does. He sees things
in their eternal beauty, for he sees them as they are; he feels
them in their universal interest, for he feels them as they
<!-- Page 137 --><span class="pagenum" style="font-size: 95%"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>affect the first principles of his and our common nature. Such
was Homer, such was Shakespeare, whose works will last as long
as nature, because they are a copy of the indestructible forms
and everlasting impulses of nature, welling out from the bosom
as from a perennial spring, or stamped upon the senses by the
hand of their maker. The power of the imagination in them, is
the representative power of all nature. It has its centre in
the human soul, and makes the circuit of the universe.</p>

<h4>JOHN WILSON, 1819<br />

(1785-1854)</h4>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">Shakespeare</span> is of no age. He speaks a language which thrills in our
blood in spite of the separation of two hundred years. His thoughts,
passions, feelings, strains of fancy, all are of this day, as they were
of his own—and his genius may be contemporary with the mind of every
generation for a thousand years to come. He, above all poets, looked
upon man, and lived for mankind. His genius, universal in intellect,
could find, in no more bounded circumference, its proper sphere. It
could not bear exclusion from any part of human existence. Whatever
in nature and life was given to man, was given in contemplation and
poetry to him also, and over the undimmed mirror of his mind passed
all the shadows of our mortal world. Look through his plays and tell
what form of existence, what quality of spirit, he is most skilful to
delineate. Which of all the manifold beings he has drawn, lives before
our thoughts, our eyes, in most unpictured reality? Is it Othello,
Shylock, Falstaff, Lear, the wife of Macbeth, Imogen, Hamlet, Ariel? In
none of the other great dramatists do we see anything like a perfected
art. In their works, everything, it is true, exists in some shape or
other, which can be required in a drama taking for its interest the
absolute interest of human life and nature; but, after all, may not
the very best of their works be looked on as sublime masses of chaotic
confusion, through which the elements of our moral being appear? It
was Shakespeare, the most unlearned of all <!-- Page 141 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>our writers, who first
exhibited on the stage perfect models, perfect images of all human
characters, and all human events. We cannot conceive any skill that
could from his great characters remove any defect, or add to their
perfect composition. Except in him, we look in vain for the entire
fulness, the self-consistency, and self-completeness of perfect art.</p>

All Nature ministers to him, as gladly as a mother to her child.
Whether he wishes her to tune her myriad-voiced organ to Romeo’s

to Rosalind’s playfulness, or to the sports of the Fairies, or to
Timon’s misanthropy, or to Macbeth’s desolating ambition, or to Lear’s
heart-broken frenzy—he has only to ask, and she puts on every feeling

<p>No poet comes near Shakespeare in the number of bosom lines,—of lines
that we may cherish in our bosoms, and that seem almost as if they
had grown there,—of lines that, like bosom friends, are ever at hand
to comfort, counsel, and gladden us, under all the vicissitudes of
life,—of lines that, according to Bacon’s expression, “come home to our
business and bosoms,” and open the door for us to look in, and see what
is nestling and brooding there.</p>

<h4>THOMAS DE QUINCEY, 1838<br />

(1785-1859)</h4>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">In</span> the great world of woman, as the interpreter of the shifting phases
and the lunar varieties of that mighty changeable planet, that lovely
satellite of man, Shakespeare stands not the first only, not the
original only, but is yet the sole authentic oracle of truth. Woman,
therefore, the beauty of the female mind, <em>this</em> is one great field of
his power. The supernatural world, the world of apparitions, <em>that</em>
is another.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. In all Christendom, who, let us ask, who, who but
Shakespeare has found the power for effectually working this mysterious
mode of being?</p>

<p class="bold noindent center">.<span style="padding-left: 4em;">.</span><span style="padding-left: 4em;">.</span><span style="padding-left: 4em;">.</span><span style="padding-left: 4em;">.</span><span style="padding-left: 4em;">.</span><span style="padding-left: 4em;">.</span></p>

<p>A third fund of Shakespeare’s peculiar power lies in his teeming
fertility of fine thoughts and sentiments. From his works alone might
be gathered a golden bead-roll of thoughts, the deepest, subtilest,
most pathetic, and yet most catholic and universally intelligible; the
most characteristic, also, and appropriate to the particular person,
the situation, and the case, yet, at the same time, applicable to
the circumstances of every human being, under all the accidents of
life, and all vicissitudes of fortune. But this subject offers so
vast a field of observation, it being so eminently the prerogative of
Shakespeare to have thought more finely and more extensively than all
other poets combined, that we cannot wrong the dignity of such a theme
by doing more, in our narrow limits, than <!-- Page 151 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>simply noticing it as one of
the emblazonries upon Shakespeare’s shield.</p>

<p>Fourthly, we shall indicate (and, as in the last case, <em>barely</em>
indicate, without attempting in so vast a field to offer any adequate
illustrations) one mode of Shakespeare’s dramatic excellence, which
hitherto has not attracted any special or separate notice. We allude
to the forms of life, and natural human passion, as apparent in the
structure of his dialogue. Among the many defects and infirmities
of the French and of the Italian drama, indeed, we may say of the
Greek, the dialogue proceeds always by independent speeches, replying
indeed to each other, but never modified in its several terminal forms
immediately preceding. Now, in Shakespeare, who first set an example
of that most important innovation, in all his impassioned dialogues,
each reply or rejoinder seems the mere rebound of the previous speech.
Every form of natural interruption, breaking through the restraints
of ceremony under the impulses of tempestuous passion; every form
of hasty interrogative, ardent reiteration when a question has been
evaded; every form of scornful repetition of the hostile words; every
impatient continuation of the hostile statement; in short, all modes
and formulæ by which anger, hurry, fretfulness, scorn, impatience,
or excitement under any movement whatever, can disturb or modify or
dislocate the formal bookish style of commencement,—these are as rife
in Shakespeare’s dialogue as in life itself; and how much vivacity,
how profound a verisimilitude, they add to the scenic effect as an
imitation of human passion and real life, we need not say. A volume
might be written, illustrating the vast varieties of Shakespeare’s art
and <!-- Page 152 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>power in this one field of improvement; another volume might be
dedicated to the exposure of the lifeless and unnatural result from the
opposite practice in the foreign stages of France and Italy. And we may
truly say, that were Shakespeare distinguished from them by this single
feature of nature and propriety, he would on that account alone have
merited a great immortality.</p>

<h4>HENRY HALLAM, 1839<br />

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">Of</span> William Shakespeare, whom, through the mouths of those whom he has
inspired to body forth the modifications of his immense mind, we seem
to know better than any human writer, it may be truly said that we
scarcely know anything. We see him, so far as we do see him, not in
himself, but in a reflex image from the objectivity in which he was
manifested: he is Falstaff, and Mercutio, and Malvolio, and Jaques, and
Portia, and Imogen, and Lear, and Othello; but to us he is scarcely
a determined person, a substantial reality of past time, the man
Shakespeare. The two greatest names in poetry are to us little more
than names. If we are not yet come to question his unity, as we do that
of “the blind old man of Scios’ rocky isle,” an improvement in critical
acuteness doubtless reserved for a distant posterity, we as little feel
the power of identifying the young man who came up from Stratford, was
afterwards an indifferent player in a London theatre, and retired to
his native place in middle life, with the author of Macbeth and Lear,
as we can give a distinct historic personality to Homer. All that
insatiable curiosity and unwearied diligence have hitherto detected
about Shakespeare serves rather to disappoint and perplex us than to
furnish the slightest illustration of his character.</p>

upward with it to the highest pinnacles of imaginative loftiness, or
beyond these even, to the empyrean of thought, where the minds of

Shakespeare, the most wonderful of mere men that we know to have ever

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">It</span> is in what I called Portrait-painting, delineating of men and
things, especially of men, that Shakespeare is great. All the greatness
of the man comes out decisively here. It is unexampled, I think, that
calm creative perspicacity of Shakespeare. The thing he looks at
reveals not this or that face of it, but its inmost heart and generic
secret: it dissolves itself as in light before him, so that he discerns
the perfect structure of it. Creative, we said; poetic creation, what
is this too but <em>seeing</em> the thing sufficiently? The <em>word</em> that will
describe the thing, follows of itself from such clear intense sight of
the thing. And is not Shakespeare’s <em>morality</em>, his valour, candour,
tolerance, truthfulness; his whole victorious strength and greatness,
which can triumph over such obstructions, visible there too? Great
as the world! No <em>twisted</em>, poor convex-concave mirror, reflecting
all objects with its own convexities and concavities; a perfectly
<em>level</em> mirror;—that is to say withal, if we will understand it, a man
justly related to all things and men, a good man. It is truly a lordly
spectacle how this great soul takes in all kinds of men and objects, a
Falstaff, an Othello, a Juliet, a Coriolanus; sets them all forth to us
in their round completeness; loving, just, the equal brother of all.

him too you say that he <em>saw</em> the object; you may say what he himself

inward mechanism also is all visible.”</p>

<h4>WILLIAM WORDSWORTH, 1841<br />

(1770-1850)</h4>

<p class="quotetitle">“<cite>Shakespeare and Goethe.</cite>”</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">He</span> (Goethe) does not seem to me to be a great poet in either of the
classes of poets. At the head of the first class I would place Homer
and Shakespeare, whose universal minds are able to reach every variety
of thought and feeling without bringing their own individuality before
the reader. They infuse, they breathe life into every object they
approach, but you never find <em>themselves</em>. At the head of the second
class, those whom you can trace individually in all they write, I would
place Spenser and Milton. In all that Spenser writes you can trace
the gentle affectionate spirit of the man; in all that Milton writes
you find the exalted sustained being that he was. Now, in what Goethe
writes, who aims to be of the first class, the <em>universal</em>, you find
the man himself, the artificial man where he should not be found; so
that I consider him a very artificial writer, aiming to be universal,
and yet constantly exposing his individuality, which his character
was not of a kind to dignify. He had not sufficiently clear moral
perceptions to make him anything but an artificial writer.</p>

<h4>THOMAS BABINGTON, LORD MACAULAY, 1843<br />

(1800-1859)</h4>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">Highest</span> among those who have exhibited human nature by means of
dialogue stands Shakespeare. His variety is like the variety of
nature, endless diversity, scarcely any monstrosity. The characters
of which he has given us an impression, as vivid as that which we
receive from the characters of our own associates, are to be reckoned
by scores. Yet in all these scores hardly one character is to be found
which deviates widely from the common standard, and which we should
call very eccentric if we met it in real life. The silly notion that
every man has one ruling passion, and that this clue, once known,
unravels all the mysteries of his conduct, finds no countenance in
the plays of Shakespeare. There man appears as he is, made up of a
crowd of passions, which contend for the mastery over him, and govern
him in turn. What is Hamlet’s ruling passion? Or Othello’s? Or Harry
the Fifth’s? Or Wolsey’s? Or Lear’s? Or Shylock’s? Or Benedick’s? Or
Macbeth’s? Or that of Cassius? Or that of Falconbridge? But we might
go on for ever. Take a single example, Shylock. Is he so eager for
money as to be indifferent to revenge? Or so eager for revenge as to be
indifferent to money? Or so bent on both together as to be indifferent
to the honour of his nation and the law of Moses? All his propensities
are mingled with each other, so that, in trying to apportion to each
its proper part, we find the same difficulty which constantly meets us
in <!-- Page 161 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>real life. A superficial critic may say, that hatred is Shylock’s
ruling passion. But how many passions have amalgamated to form that
hatred? It is partly the result of wounded pride: Antonio has called
him dog. It is partly the result of covetousness: Antonio has hindered
him of half a million; and, when Antonio is gone, there will be no
limit to the gains of usury. It is partly the result of national and
religious feeling: Antonio has spit on the Jewish gabardine; and the
oath of revenge has been sworn by the Jewish Sabbath. We might go
through all the characters which we have mentioned, and through fifty
more in the same way; for it is the constant manner of Shakespeare to
represent the human mind as lying, not under the absolute dominion
of one despotic propensity, but under a mixed government, in which a
hundred powers balance each other. Admirable as he is in all parts
of his art, we most admire him for this, that while he has left us a
greater number of striking portraits than all other dramatists put
together, he has scarcely left us a single caricature.</p>

<h4>RALPH WALDO EMERSON, 1844<br />

(1803-1882)</h4>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">Shakespeare</span> is the only biographer of Shakespeare; and even he can
tell nothing except to the Shakespeare in us; that is, to our most
apprehensive and sympathetic hour. He cannot step from off his tripod,
and give us anecdotes of his inspirations. Read the antique documents
extricated, analysed, and compared, by the assiduous Dyce and Collier;
and now read one of those skiey sentences—aerolites,—which seem to
have fallen out of heaven, and which, not your experience, but the man
within the breast, has accepted as words of fate; and tell me if they
match, if the former account in any manner for the latter: or, which
gives the most historical insight into the man.</p>

<p>Hence, though our external history is so meagre, yet, with Shakespeare
for biographer, instead of Aubrey and Rowe, we have really the
information which is material, that which describes character and
fortune, that which, if we were about to meet the man and deal with
him, would most import us to know. We have his recorded convictions
on those questions which knock for answer at every heart,—on life and
death, on love, on wealth and poverty, on the prizes of life, and
the ways whereby we come at them; on the characters of men, and the
influences, occult and open, which affect their fortunes; and on those
mysterious and demoniacal powers which defy our science, and which yet
interweave their malice and their gift in our brightest hours. Whoever
read the volume of the <!-- Page 163 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>Sonnets, without finding that the poet had
there revealed, under masks that are no masks to the intelligent, the
lore of friendship and of love; the confusion of sentiments in the most
susceptible, and, at the same time, the most intellectual of men? What
trait of his private mind has he hidden in his dramas? One can discern,
in his ample pictures of the gentleman and the king, that forms and
humanities pleased him; his delight in troops of friends, in large
hospitality, in cheerful giving. Let Timon, let Warwick, let Antonio
the merchant, answer for his great heart. So far from Shakespeare’s
being the least known, he is the one person, in all modern history,
known to us. What point of morals, of manners, of economy, of
philosophy, of religion, of taste, of the conduct of life, has he not
settled? What mystery has he not signified his knowledge of? What
office, or function, or district of man’s work, has he not remembered?
What king has he not taught State, as Talma taught Napoleon? What
maiden has not found him finer than her delicacy? What lover has he
not outloved? What sage has he not outseen? What gentleman has he not
instructed in the rudeness of his behaviour?</p>

<h4>FREDERICK WILLIAM ROBERTSON, 1850<br />

(1816-1853)</h4>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">What</span> I admire in Shakspeare, however, is that his loves are all
human—no earthliness hiding itself from itself in sentimental
transcendentalism—no loves of the angels, which are the least angelic
things, I believe, that float in the clouds, though they do look down
upon mortal feelings with contempt, just as the dark volumes of smoke
which issue from the long chimney of a manufactory might brood very
sublimely over the town which they blacken, and fancy themselves far
more ethereal than those vapours which steam up from the earth by day
and night. Yet these are pure water, and those are destined to condense
in black soot. So are the transcendentalisms of affection. Shakspeare
is healthy, true to Humanity in this: and for that reason I pardon him
even his earthly coarseness. You always know that you are on an earth
which has to be refined, instead of floating in the empyrean with wings
of wax. Therein he is immeasurably greater than Shelley. Shelleyism is
very sublime, sublimer a good deal than God, for God’s world is all
wrong and Shelley is all right—much purer than Christ, for Shelley can
criticise Christ’s heart and life—nevertheless, Shelleyism is only
atmospheric profligacy, to coin a Montgomeryism. I believe this to
be one of Shakespeare’s most wondrous qualities—the humanity of his
nature and heart. There is a spirit of sunny <!-- Page 165 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>endeavour about him, and
an acquiescence in things as they are—not incompatible with a cheerful
resolve to make them better.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">How</span> naturally the idea of Shakespeare can be made to associate itself
with anything which is worth mention! Take Christmas for instance:
“Shakespeare and Christmas”; the two ideas fall as happily together
as “wine and walnuts,” or heart and soul. So you may put together
“Shakespeare and May,” or “Shakespeare and June,” and twenty passages
start into your memory about spring and violets. Or you may say
“Shakespeare and Love,” and you are in the midst of a bevy of bright
damsels, as sweet as rosebuds; or “Shakespeare and Death,” and all
graves, and thoughts of graves, are before you; or “Shakespeare and
Life,” and you have the whole world of youth, and spirit, and Hotspur,
and life itself; or you may say even, “Shakespeare and Hate,” and he
will say all that can be said for hate, as well as against it, till you
shall take Shylock himself into your Christian arms, and tears shall

<h4>JAMES ANTHONY FROUDE, 1852<br />

(1818-1894)</h4>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">We</span> wonder at the grandeur, the moral majesty of some of Shakespeare’s
characters, so far beyond what the noblest among ourselves can imitate,
and at first thought we attribute it to the genius of the poet, who
has outstripped nature in his creations. But we are misunderstanding
the power and the meaning of poetry in attributing creativeness to
it in any such sense. Shakespeare created, but only as the spirit of
nature created around him, working in him as it worked abroad in those
among whom he lived. The men whom he draws were such men as he saw
and knew; the words they utter were such as he heard in the ordinary
conversations in which he joined. At the Mermaid with Raleigh and
with Sidney, and at a thousand unnamed English firesides, he found
the living originals for his Prince Hals, his Orlandos, his Antonios,
his Portias, his Isabellas. The closer personal acquaintance which we
can form with the English of the age of Elizabeth, the more we are
satisfied that Shakespeare’s great poetry is no more than the rhythmic
echo of the life which it depicts.</p>

It is as if into a mind poetical in <em>form</em> there had been poured all
the <em>matter</em> that existed in the mind of his contemporary Bacon. In
Shakespeare’s plays we have thought, history, exposition, philosophy,
all within the round of the poet. The only difference between him and
Bacon sometimes is that Bacon writes an essay and calls it his own,
while Shakespeare writes a similar essay and puts it into the mouth of
a Ulysses or a Polonius.</p>

<h4>JOHN HENRY NEWMAN, 1858<br />

(1801-1890)</h4>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">A great</span> author, gentlemen, is not one who merely has a <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">copia
verborum</i>, whether in prose or verse, and can, as it were, turn on at
his will any number of splendid phrases and swelling sentences; but he
is one who has something to say and knows how to say it. I do not claim
for him, as such, any great depth of thought, or breadth of view, or
philosophy, or sagacity, or knowledge of human nature, or experience
of human life, though these additional gifts he may have, and the
more he has of them the greater he is; but I ascribe to him, as his
characteristic gift, in a large sense the faculty of Expression. He
is master of the twofold Logos, the thought and the word, distinct,
but inseparable from each other. He may, if so be, elaborate his
compositions, or he may pour out his improvisations, but in either
case he has but one aim, which he keeps steadily before him, and is
conscientious and single-minded in fulfilling. That aim is to give
forth what he has within him; and from his very earnestness it comes to
pass that, whatever be the splendour of his diction or the harmony of
his periods, he has with him the charm of an incommunicable simplicity.
Whatever be his subject, high or low, he treats it suitably and for its
own sake. If he is a poet, “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">nil molitur <em>inepte</em></span>.” If he is an orator,
then too he speaks, not only “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">distincte</span>” and “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">splendide</span>,” but also
“<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">apte</span>.” His page is the lucid mirror of his mind and life:</p>

<p><!-- Page 172 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
He writes passionately, because he feels keenly; forcibly, because
he conceives vividly; he sees too clearly to be vague; he is too
serious to be otiose; he can analyse his subject, and therefore he is
rich; he embraces it as a whole and in its parts, and therefore he is
consistent; he has a firm hold of it, and therefore he is luminous;
when his imagination wells up, it overflows its ornament; when his
heart is touched, it thrills along his verse. He always has the right
word for the right idea, and never a word too much. If he is brief, it
is because few words suffice; when he is lavish of them, still each
word has its mark, and aids, not embarrasses, the vigorous march of
his elocution. He expresses what all feel, but all cannot say; and his
sayings pass into proverbs among his people, and his phrases become
household words and idioms of their daily speech, which is tessellated
with the rich fragments of his language, as we see in foreign lands the
marbles of Roman grandeur worked into the walls and pavements of modern
palaces.</p>

<h4>JAMES RUSSELL LOWELL, <abbr title="circa"><i>c.</i></abbr> 1858<br />

(1819-1891)</h4>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">Only</span> Shakespeare was endowed with that healthy equilibrium of nature
whose point of rest was midway between the imagination and the
understanding,—that perfectly unruffled brain which reflected all
objects with almost inhuman impartiality,—that outlook whose range was
ecliptical, dominating all zones of human thought and action,—that
power of verisimilar conception which could take away Richard
<abbr title="the Third"><span class="allcapsc">III.</span></abbr> from History, and Ulysses from Homer,—and that creative
faculty whose equal touch is alike vivifying in Shallow and in Lear.
He alone never seeks in abnormal and monstrous characters to evade the
risks and responsibilities of absolute truthfulness, nor to stimulate a
jaded imagination by Caligulan horrors of plot. He is never, like many
of his fellow-dramatists, confronted with unnatural Frankensteins of
his own making, whom he must get off his hands as best he may. Given
a human foible, he can incarnate it in the nothingness of Slender, or
make it loom gigantic through the tragic twilight of Hamlet. We are
tired of the vagueness which classes all the Elizabethan playwrights
together as “great dramatists,”—as if Shakespeare did not differ from
them in kind as well as in degree. Fine poets some of them were; but
though imagination and the power of poetic expression are, singly, not
uncommon gifts, and even in combination not without secular examples,
yet it is the rarest of earthly phenomena to find them joined with
<!-- Page 174 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>those faculties of perception, arrangement, and plastic instinct in
the loving union which alone makes a great dramatic poet possible.
We suspect that Shakespeare will long continue the only specimen of
the genus. His contemporaries, in their comedies, either force what
they call “a humour” till it becomes fantastical, or hunt for jokes,
like rat-catchers, in the sewers of human nature and of language.
In their tragedies they become heavy without grandeur, like Jonson,
or mistake the stilts for the cothurnus, as Chapman and Webster too
often do. Every new edition of an Elizabethan dramatist is but the
putting of another witness into the box to prove the inaccessibility of
Shakespeare’s standpoint as poet and artist.</p>

authors, who have written upon subjects not professedly religious or

so much evidence of the Bible having been read and used, as we have
found in Shakespeare <em>alone</em>. This is a phenomenon which admits of
being looked at from several points of view; but I shall be content to
regard it solely in connection with the undoubted fact, that of all our
authors, Shakespeare is also, by general confession, the greatest and
the best. According to the testimony of Charles Lamb, a most competent
judge in regard to all the literary elements of the question, our poet,
“in his divine mind and manners, surpassed not only the great men his
contemporaries, but all mankind.” And, looking at this superiority from
my own point of view, I cannot but remark that, while most of the great
laymen of that great Elizabethan age—Lord Bacon, Sir Walter Raleigh,
the poet Spenser, Sir Philip Sidney, Lord Burleigh, Ben Jonson—have
paid homage to Christianity, if not always in their practice, yet in
the conviction of their understanding, none of them has done this so
fully or so effectively as Shakespeare.</p>

<h4>FRANCIS TURNER PALGRAVE, 1865<br />

(1824-1897)</h4>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">Only</span> three or four generations of fairly long-lived men lie between
us and Shakespeare; literature in his own time had reached a high
development; his grandeur and sweetness were freely recognised; within
seventy years of his death his biography was attempted; yet we know
little more of Shakespeare himself than we do of Homer. Like several of
the greatest men,—Lucretius, Virgil, Tacitus, Dante,—a mystery never
to be dispelled hangs over his life. He has entered into the cloud.
With a natural and an honourable diligence, other men have given their
lives to the investigation of his, and many external circumstances,
mostly of a minor order, have been thus collected: yet of “the man
Shakespeare,” in Mr. Hallam’s words, we know nothing. Something which
seems more than human in immensity of range and calmness of insight
moves before us in the Plays; but, from the nature of dramatic writing,
the author’s personality is inevitably veiled; no letter, no saying
of his, or description by an intimate friend, has been preserved: and
even when we turn to the <cite>Sonnets</cite>, though each is an autobiographical
confession, we find ourselves equally foiled. These revelations of
the poet’s innermost nature appear to teach us less of the man than
the tone of mind which we trace, or seem to trace, in <cite>Measure for
Measure</cite>, <cite>Hamlet</cite>, and the <cite>Tempest</cite>: the strange imagery of passion
which passes over the magic mirror has no tangible existence before or
behind it:—the great artist, like Nature <!-- Page 182 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>herself, is still latent in
his works; diffused through his own creation.</p>

<p>Yet there is, after all, nothing more remarkable or fascinating in
English poetry than these personal revelations of the mind of our
greatest poet. We read them again and again, and find each time some
new proof of his almost superhuman insight into human nature; of his
unrivalled mastery over all the tones of love.</p>

<h4>WILLIAM MINTO, 1874<br />

(1845-1893)</h4>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">It</span> is a favourite way with some eulogists of Shakespeare to deny him
all individuality whatsoever. He was not one man, they say, but an
epitome of all men. His mind, says Hazlitt, “had no one peculiar bias
or exclusive excellence more than another. He was just like any other
man, but that he was like all other men. He was the least of an egotist
that it was possible to be. He was nothing in himself; but he was all
that others were or that they could become.” Against such a degradation
of Shakespeare’s character, or of any man’s character, it is our duty
to protest. On trying to make Shakespeare more than human, the reckless
panegyrist makes him considerably less than human: instead of the man
whose prudence made him rich, whose affectionate nature made him loved
almost to idolatry, and whose genius has been the wonder of the world,
we are presented with plasticity in the abstract, an object not more
interesting than a quarry of potter’s clay.</p>

<h4>EDWARD DOWDEN, 1875<br />

(<abbr title="born"><i>b.</i></abbr> 1843)</h4>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">There</span> are certain problems which Shakespeare at once pronounces
insoluble. He does not, like Milton, propose to give any account of
the origin of evil. He does not, like Dante, pursue the soul of man
through circles of unending torture, or spheres made radiant by the
eternal presence of God. Satan, in Shakespeare’s poems, does not come
voyaging on gigantic vans across Chaos to find the earth. No great
deliverer of mankind descends from the heavens. Here, upon the earth,
evil <em>is</em>—such was Shakespeare’s declaration in the most emphatic
accent. Iago actually exists. There is also in the earth a sacred
passion of deliverance, a pure redeeming ardour. Cordelia exists. This
Shakespeare can tell for certain. But how Iago can be, and why Cordelia
lies strangled across the breast of Lear—are these questions which
you go on to ask? Something has been already said of the severity of
Shakespeare. It is a portion of his severity to decline all answers
to such questions as these. Is ignorance painful? Well, then, it is
painful. Little solutions of your large difficulties can readily be
obtained from priest or <em>philosopher</em>. Shakespeare prefers to let you
remain in the solemn presence of a mystery. He does not invite you into
his little church or his little library brilliantly illuminated by
philosophical or theological rushlights. You remain in the darkness.
But you remain in the vital air. And the great night is overhead.</p>

comic spirit; with more of what we will call blood-life than is to be
found anywhere out of Shakespeare; and they are of this world, but they
are of the world enlarged to our embrace by imagination, and by great
poetic imagination. They are, as it were—I put it to suit my present
comparison—creatures of the woods and wilds, not in walled towns, not
grouped and toned to pursue a comic exhibition of the narrower world of
society. Jaques, Falstaff and his regiment, the varied troop of clowns,
Malvolio, Sir Hugh Evans and Fluellen—marvellous Welshmen!—Benedict

study in the poetically comic.</p>

<h4>WALTER HORATIO PATER, 1878<br />

(1839-1894)</h4>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">As</span> happens with every true dramatist, Shakespeare is for the most
part hidden behind the persons of his creation. Yet there are certain
of his characters in which we feel that there is something of
self-portraiture. And it is not so much in his grander, more subtle and
ingenious creations that we feel this—in “Hamlet” and “King Lear”—as
in those slighter and more spontaneously developed figures, who, while
far from playing principal parts, are yet distinguished by a peculiar
happiness and delicate ease in the drawing of them; figures which
possess, above all, that winning attractiveness which there is no man
but would willingly exercise, and which resemble those works of art
which, though not meant to be very great or imposing, are yet wrought
of the choicest material. Mercutio, in “Romeo and Juliet,” belongs to
this group of Shakespeare’s characters—versatile, mercurial people,
such as make good actors, and in whom the</p>

<div class="poem">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="line">“Nimble spirits of the arteries,”</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">the finer but still merely animal elements of great wit, predominate.
A careful delineation of minor yet expressive traits seems to mark
them out as the characters of his predilection; and it is hard not
to identify him with these more than with others. Biron, in “Love’s
Labour’s Lost,” is perhaps the most striking member of this group.
In this character, which is never quite in touch, never quite <!-- Page 194 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>on a
perfect level of understanding, with the other persons of the play, we
see, perhaps, a reflex of Shakespeare himself, when he has just become
able to stand aside from and estimate the first period of his poetry.</p>

<h4>MATTHEW ARNOLD, 1879<br />

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">Let</span> me have the pleasure of quoting a sentence about Shakespeare, which
I met with by accident not long ago in the <cite>Correspondant</cite>, a French
review which not a dozen English people, I suppose, look at. The writer
is praising Shakespeare’s prose. “With Shakespeare,” he says, “prose
comes in whenever the subject, being more familiar, is unsuited to the
majestic English iambic.” And he goes on: “Shakespeare is the king of
poetic rhythm and style, as well as the king of the realm of thought;
along with his dazzling prose, Shakespeare has succeeded in giving us
the most varied, the most harmonious verse which has ever sounded upon
the human ear since the verse of the Greeks.” <abbr title="Monsieur">M.</abbr> Henry Cochin, the
writer of this sentence, deserves our gratitude for it; it would not
be easy to praise Shakespeare, in a single sentence, more justly. And
when a foreigner and a Frenchman writes thus of Shakespeare, and when
Goethe says of Milton, in whom there was so much to repel Goethe rather
than to attract him, that “nothing has ever been done so entirely in
the sense of the Greeks as <cite>Samson Agonistes</cite>,” and that “Milton is
in very truth a poet whom we must treat with all reverence,” then we
understand what constitutes a European recognition of poets and poetry
as contradistinguished from a merely national recognition, and that
in favour both of Milton and <!-- Page 196 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>of Shakespeare the judgment of the high
court of appeal has finally gone.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">So</span> much has been written, so much spoken about Shakespeare, that it
would seem a needless, almost a presumptuous superfluity to say more,
and yet from another point of view, the man is as strange to us to-day
as though we had never heard his name. Johnson and Pope, Warburton,
Steevens, Malone and Theobald, Chalmers, Dyce, and a host of foreign
exegetes, have edited and annotated, emendated and obelised; but the
figure of Shakespeare is clothed in mist, and whilst we laugh and
wonder at the vanity and versatility of a Cicero, and stroll lovingly
with a Horace about his Sabine farm, dead both of them two millennia,
we still grope about in the dark for the meaning, the character,
and the inner life of our wondrous poet. Like the ghost in Hamlet,
he arose, and, having uttered his pregnant message, disappeared,
unregarded at the time but by a few, and still unrealised by the many.</p>

<p>There is a grandeur about the poets of the world, and a reward for
those that study them aright. Amid the hurricane of battle and the
crash of empires, the calm pulse of life and the glories of the drama
remain the same. Men are inclined to gaze upon the outward symbols of
existence as though they were primary causes, when they are only the
emblems of a deeper power. We have had our Constitution-builders, but
where are they? Our Tamerlanes and our Attilas, but whither are they
departed? The intellect that revolves a kingdom pales before a heart
<!-- Page 198 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>that speaks to the soul of man. All nations turn their faces toward
a Hamlet, a Lear, or a Catherine of Aragon. The influence of these
through the genius of the poet will spread and yield abundant fruit,
when the havoc of a Cannæ or an Austerlitz is but dimly discernible in
the skeleton of history.</p>

<p>The study of our finer literature is therefore the study of the soul;
and the progress made will be upward and inward, and the result
a purifying of the ideals and a chastening of the chords of man.
Shakespeare gives us all this, he is ennobling as well as instructive;
without paying homage in a measure to his memory by the maintenance of
a certain form of excellence, no poet since his time has succeeded in
being appreciated as great. For they all bear his mark, and although
much below him, all dramatic writers since his day are modelled upon
his plan.</p>

<h4>ALGERNON CHARLES SWINBURNE, 1880<br />

(<abbr title="born"><i>b.</i></abbr> 1837)</h4>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">In</span> his first stage Shakespeare had dropped his plummet no deeper into
the sea of the spirit of man than Marlowe had sounded before him; and
in the channel of simple emotion no poet could cast surer line with
steadier hand than he. Further down in the dark and fiery depths of
human pain and mortal passion no soul could search than his who first
rendered into speech the aspirations and the agonies of a ruined and
revolted spirit. And until Shakespeare found in himself the strength of
eyesight to read, and the cunning of handiwork to render those wider
diversities of emotion and those further complexities of character
which lay outside the range of Marlowe, he certainly cannot be said
to have outrun the winged feet, outstripped the fiery flight of his
forerunner. In the heaven of our tragic song, the first-born star on
the forehead of its herald god was not outshone till the full midsummer
meridian of that greater godhead before whom he was sent to prepare
a pathway for the sun. Through all the forenoon of our triumphant
day, till the utter consummation and ultimate ascension of dramatic
poetry incarnate and transfigured in the master-singer of the world,
the quality of his tragedy was as that of Marlowe’s, broad, single,
and intense; large of hand, voluble of tongue, direct of purpose.
With the dawn of its latter epoch a new power comes upon it, to find
clothing and expression in new forms of speech and after a new style.
<!-- Page 200 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>The language has put off its foreign decorations of lyric and elegiac
ornament; it has found already its infinite gain in the loss of those
sweet superfluous graces which encumbered the march and enchained the
utterance of its childhood. The figures which it invests are now no
more types of a single passion, the incarnations of a single thought.
They now demand a scrutiny which tests the power of a mind and tries
the value of a judgment; they appeal to something more than the instant
apprehension which sufficed to respond to the immediate claim of those
that went before them. Romeo and Juliet were simply lovers, and their
names bring back to us no further thought than of their love and the
lovely sorrow of its end; Antony and Cleopatra shall be before all
things lovers, but the thought of their love and its triumphant tragedy
shall recall other things beyond number—all the forces and all the
fortunes of mankind, all the chance and all the consequence that waited
on their imperial passion, all the infinite variety of qualities and
powers wrought together and welded into the frame and composition of
that love which shook from end to end all nations and kingdoms of the
earth.</p>

<h4>THOMAS SPENCER BAYNES, 1886<br />

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">Shakespeare’s</span> work alone can be said to possess the organic strength
and infinite variety, the throbbing fulness, vital complexity, and
breathing truth of Nature herself. In points of artistic resource and
technical ability—such as copious and expressive diction, freshness and
pregnancy of verbal combination, richly modulated verse, and structural
skill in the handling of incident and action—Shakespeare’s supremacy
is indeed sufficiently assured. But, after all, it is of course in the
spirit and substance of his work, his power of piercing to the hidden
centres of character, of touching the deepest springs of impulse and
passion, out of which are the issues of life, and of evolving those
issues dramatically with a flawless strength, subtlety, and truth,
which raises him so immensely above and beyond not only the best of
the playwrights who went before him, but the whole line of illustrious
dramatists that came after him. It is Shakespeare’s unique distinction
that he has an absolute command over all the complexities of thought
and feeling that prompt to action and bring out the dividing lines of
character. He sweeps with the hand of a master the whole gamut of human
experience, from the lowest note to the very top of its compass, from
the sportive childish treble of Mamilius, and the pleading boyish tones
of Prince Arthur, up to the spectre-haunted terrors of Macbeth, the
tropical passion of Othello, the agonised sense <!-- Page 208 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>and tortured spirit

<h4>WALT WHITMAN, 1890<br />

(1819-1892)</h4>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">The</span> inward and outward characteristics of Shakespeare are his vast and
rich variety of persons and themes, with his wondrous delineation of
each and all—not only limitless funds of verbal and pictorial resource,
but great excess, superfœtation—mannerism, like a fine aristocratic
perfume, holding a touch of musk (Euphues, his mark)—with boundless
sumptuousness and adornment, real velvet and gems, not shoddy nor
paste—but a good deal of bombast and fustian—(certainly some terrific
mouthing in Shakespeare!).</p>

<p>Superb and inimitable as all is, it is mostly an objective and
physiological kind of power and beauty the soul finds in Shakespeare—a
style supremely grand of the sort, but in my opinion stopping short of
the grandest sort, at any rate for fulfilling and satisfying modern
and scientific and democratic American purposes. Think, not of growths
as forests primeval, or Yellowstone geysers, or Colorado ravines, but
of costly marble palaces, and palace rooms, and the noblest fixings
and furniture, and noble owners and occupants to correspond—think of
carefully built gardens from the beautiful but sophisticated gardening
art at its best, with walks and bowers and artificial lakes, and
appropriate statue groups, and the finest cultivated roses and lilies
and japonicas in plenty—and you have the tally of Shakespeare. The
low characters, mechanics, even the loyal henchmen—all in themselves
nothing—serve as capital foils to the aristocracy. The comedies
(exquisite <!-- Page 211 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>as they certainly are), bringing in admirably portrayed
common characters, have the unmistakable hue of plays, portraits, made
for the divertisement only of the élite of the castle, and from its
point of view. The comedies are altogether non-acceptable to America
and Democracy.</p>

<p>But to the deepest soul, it seems a shame to pick and choose from the
riches Shakespeare has left us—to criticise his infinitely royal,
multiform quality—to gauge, with optic glasses, the dazzle of his
sun-like beams.</p>

<div class="bqsmall">
<p>Walt Whitman, when he says that “the comedies are altogether
non-acceptable to America and Democracy,” states rather what
he considers ought to be, than what actually is. In his essay,
“Poetry To-day in America,” he says of Shakespeare, “In
portraying mediæval European lords and barons, the arrogant
poet, so dear to the inmost human heart (pride! pride! dearest,
perhaps, of all—touching us, too, of the States closest of
all—closer than love), he stands alone, and I do not wonder he
so witches the world.”—<cite>Prose Works</cite>, Boston, 1898, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 283.</p>

(1809-1892)</h4>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">There</span> are three repartees in Shakespeare which always bring tears to my
eyes from their simplicity.</p>

<p>One is in <cite>King Lear</cite>, when Lear says to Cordelia, “So young and so
untender,” and Cordelia lovingly answers, “So young, my lord, and
true.” And in <cite>The Winter’s Tale</cite>, when Florizel takes Perdita’s hand
to lead her to the dance, and says, “So turtles pair that never mean
to part,” and the little Perdita answers, giving her hand to Florizel,
”I’ll swear for ’em.” And in <cite>Cymbeline</cite>, when Imogen in tender rebuke
says to her husband:</p>

<div class="poem">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="line">“Why did you throw your wedded lady from you?</div>
    <div class="line indentq">Think that you are upon a rock; and now,</div>

<h4>SIDNEY LEE, 1899<br />

(<abbr title="born"><i>b.</i></abbr> 1859)</h4>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">Shakespeare’s</span> mind, as Hazlitt suggested, contained within itself the
germs of all faculty and feeling. He knew intuitively how every faculty
and feeling would develop in any conceivable change of fortune. Men
and women—good or bad, old or young, wise or foolish, merry or sad,
rich or poor—yielded their secrets to him, and his genius enabled him
to give being in his pages to all the shapes of humanity that present
themselves on the highway of life. Each of his characters gives voice
to thought or passion with an individuality and a naturalness that
rouse in the intelligent playgoer and reader the illusion that they are
overhearing men and women speak unpremeditatingly among themselves,
rather than that they are reading written speeches or hearing written
speeches recited. The more closely the words are studied, the completer
the illusion grows. Creatures of the imagination—fairies, ghosts,
witches—are delineated with a like potency, and the reader or spectator
feels instinctively that these supernatural entities could not speak,
feel, or act otherwise than Shakespeare represents them. The creative
power of poetry was never manifested to such effect as in the corporeal
semblances in which Shakespeare clad the spirits of the air.</p>

<p>So mighty a faculty sets at nought the common limitations of
nationality, and in every quarter of the globe to which civilised life
has penetrated, Shakespeare’s power is <!-- Page 216 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>recognised. All the world over,
language is applied to his creations that ordinarily applies to beings
of flesh and blood. Hamlet and Othello, Lear and Macbeth, Falstaff and
Shylock, Brutus and Romeo, Ariel and Caliban are studied in almost
every civilised tongue as if they were historic personalities, and the
chief of the impressive phrases that fall from their lips are rooted
in the speech of civilised humanity. To Shakespeare the intellect of
the world, speaking in divers accents, applies with one accord his own
words: “How noble in reason! how infinite in faculty! in apprehension
how like a god!”</p>

<span class="smcap">Shakespeare</span> came out of Nature’s hand like Pallas out of Jove’s head,
at full growth and mature.</p>

<p class="source"><span class="smcap">George Colman</span> (1733-1794), before 1767.</p>

<div class="bqsmall">
<p>George Colman, who advocated the theory that Shakespeare had
some classic learning, commenting in the Appendix to the second
edition of his translation of the comedies of Terence (1768)
on Richard Farmer’s <cite>Essay on the Learning of Shakespeare</cite>
(1767), which maintains that Shakespeare got his knowledge of
the ancients from translations, says: “Mr. Farmer closes these
general testimonies of Shakespeare’s having been only indebted
to Nature, by saying, ‘He came out of her hand, <em>as some one
else expresses it</em>, like Pallas out of Jove’s head, at full
growth and mature.’ It is whimsical enough, that this <em>some
one else</em>, whose expression is here quoted to countenance the
general notion of Shakespeare’s want of literature, should be
no other than myself. Mr. Farmer does not choose to mention
where he met with this expression of <em>some one else</em>; and <em>some
one else</em> does not choose to mention where he dropped it.”
Colman’s “Appendix” was printed in the “Variorum” editions of
Shakespeare, and that of 1785 gave an anonymous note, stating
that Young “in his <cite>Conjectures on Original Composition</cite> (<abbr title="volume five, page">vol.
v. p.</abbr> 100, <abbr title="edition">ed.</abbr> 1773) has the following sentence: ‘An adult
genius comes out of Nature’s hands, as Pallas out of Jove’s
head, at full growth and mature.’ Shakespeare’s genius was
of this kind.” Young’s <cite>Conjectures</cite> appeared in 1759, so
perhaps Colman borrowed, though, as he says (<cite>Prose on Several
Occasions</cite>, 1787, <abbr title="two, page">ii. p.</abbr> 186), “The thought is obvious, and
might, without improbability, occur to different writers.” At
any rate, his form of the thought is better than Young’s, so he
has here been given the credit for it.</p>

yet he professed so little to be a teacher, that he has often been

(1624?-1674)</h3>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">Remember</span>, when we were very young maids, one day we were discoursing
about lovers, and we did enjoin each other to confess who professed to
love us, and whom we loved, and I confessed I was in love with three
dead men, which were dead long before my time, the one was Cæsar, for
his valour, the second Ovid, for his wit, and the third our countryman
Shakespeare, for his comical and tragical humour; but soon after we
both married two worthy men, and I will leave you to your own husband,
for you best know what he is. As for my husband, I know him to have
the valour of Cæsar, the fancy and wit of Ovid, and the tragical,
especially comical art of Shakespeare, in truth, he is as far beyond
Shakespeare for comical humour, as Shakespeare is beyond an ordinary
poet in that way.</p>

<h3>JOSEPH ADDISON, 1711<br />

(1672-1719)</h3>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">Some</span> years ago I was at the tragedy of “Macbeth,” and unfortunately
placed myself under a woman of quality, that is since dead; who, as I
found by the noise she made, was newly returned from France. A little
before the rising of the curtain, she broke out into a loud soliloquy,
“When will the dear witches enter?” and immediately upon their first
appearance, asked a lady that sat three boxes from her, on her right
hand, if those witches were not charming creatures. A little later, as
Betterton was in one of the finest speeches of the play, she shook her
fan at another lady, who sat as far on her left hand, and told her in
a whisper that might be heard all over the pit, “We must not expect to
see Balloon to-night.” Not long after, calling out to a young baronet
by his name, who sat three seats before me, she asked him whether
Macbeth’s wife was still alive; and before he could give an answer,
fell a-talking of the ghost of Banquo. She had by this time formed a
little audience to herself, and fixed the attention of all about her.
But as I had a mind to hear the play, I got out of the sphere of her
impertinence, and planted myself in one of the remotest corners of the
pit.</p>

<h3>HENRY FIELDING, 1743<br />

(1707-1754)</h3>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">I then</span> observed Shakespeare standing between Betterton and Booth, and
deciding a difference between these two great actors concerning the
placing an accent in one of his lines: this was disputed on both sides
with a warmth which surprised me in Elysium, till I discovered by
intuition that every soul retained its principal characteristic, being,
indeed, its very essence. The line was that celebrated one in <cite>Othello</cite>—</p>

<div class="poem">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="line">Put out the light, and then put out the light,</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">according to Betterton. Mr. Booth contended to have it thus:—</p>

<div class="poem">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="line">Put out the light, and then put out <em>the</em> light.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">I could not help offering my conjecture on this occasion, and suggested
it might perhaps be—</p>

<div class="poem">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="line">Put out the light, and then put out <em>thy</em> light.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Another hinted a reading very sophisticated in my opinion—</p>

<div class="poem">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="line">Put out the light, and then put out <em>thee</em>, light.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Making light to be the vocative case. Another would have altered the
last word, and read—</p>

<div class="poem">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="line">Put out thy light, and then put out thy <em>sight</em>.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">But Betterton said, if the text was to be disturbed, he saw no reason
why a word might not be changed as well as a letter, and instead of
“put out thy light,” you may read <!-- Page 280 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>“put out thy eyes.” At last it was
agreed on all sides to refer the matter to the decision of Shakespeare
himself, who delivered his sentiments as follows: “Faith, gentlemen,
it is so long since I wrote the line, I have forgot my meaning. This I
know, could I have dreamt so much nonsense would have been talked and
writ about it, I would have blotted it out of my works; for I am sure,
if any of these be my meaning, it doth me very little honour.”</p>

<p>He was then interrogated concerning some other ambiguous passages
in his works; but he declined any satisfactory answer; saying, if
Mr. Theobald had not writ about it sufficiently, there were three or
four more new editions of his plays coming out, which he hoped would
satisfy every one: concluding, “I marvel nothing so much as that men
will gird themselves at discovering obscure beauties in an author.
Certes the greatest and most pregnant beauties are ever the plainest
and most evidently striking; and when two meanings of a passage can in
the least balance our judgments which to prefer, I hold it matter of
unquestionable certainty that neither of them is worth a farthing.”</p>

<p>From his works our conversation turned on his monument; upon which
Shakespeare, shaking his sides, and addressing himself to Milton, cried
out, “On my word, brother Milton, they have brought a noble set of
poets together; they would have been hanged erst have convened such a
company at their tables when alive.” “True, brother,” answered Milton,
“unless we had been as incapable of eating then as we are now.”</p>

<h3>OLIVER GOLDSMITH, 1765<br />

(1728-1774)</h3>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">The</span> character of old Falstaff, even with all his faults, gives me more
consolation than the most studied efforts of wisdom: I here behold an
agreeable old fellow, forgetting age, and showing me the way to be
young at sixty-five. Sure I am well able to be as merry, though not so
comical, as he. Is it not in my power to have, though not so much wit,
at least as much vivacity?—Age, care, wisdom, reflection, begone!—I
give you to the winds. Let’s have t’other bottle: here’s to the memory
of Shakespeare, Falstaff, and all the merry men of Eastcheap.</p>

<p>Such were the reflections that naturally arose while I sat at the
Boar’s-head tavern, still kept at Eastcheap. Here, by a pleasant fire,
in the very room where old Sir John Falstaff cracked his jokes, in the
very chair which was sometimes honoured by Prince Henry, and sometimes
polluted by his immoral merry companions, I sat and ruminated on the
follies of youth; wished to be young again; but was resolved to make
the best of life while it lasted, and now and then compared past and
present times together.</p>

<h3>GEORGE, LORD LYTTELTON, 1765<br />

(1709-1773)</h3>

<p class="quotetitle">“<cite>Boileau—Pope.</cite>”</p>

<p class="center">BOILEAU</p>

<p class="noindent">.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. <span class="smcap">The</span> office of an <em>editor</em> was below you, and your mind was unfit
for the drudgery it requires. Would anybody think of employing a
Raphael to clean an old picture?</p>

<p class="center">POPE</p>

<p>The principal cause of my undertaking that task was zeal for the honour
of Shakespeare: and if you knew all his beauties as well as I, you
would not wonder at this zeal. No other author had ever so copious,
so bold, so <em>creative</em> an imagination, with so perfect a knowledge of
the passions, the humours, and sentiments of mankind. He painted all
characters, from kings down to peasants, with equal truth and equal
force. If human nature were destroyed, and no monument were left of it
except his works, other beings might know <em>what man was</em> from those
writings.</p>

<p class="center">BOILEAU</p>

<p>You say he painted all characters, from kings down to peasants, with
equal truth and equal force. I cannot deny that he did so; but I wish
he had not jumbled those characters together, in the composition of his
pictures, as he has frequently done.</p>

<p class="center"><!-- Page 293 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
POPE</p>

<p>The strange mixture of tragedy, comedy, and farce in the same
play, nay, sometimes in the same scene, I acknowledge to be quite
inexcusable. But this was the taste of the times when Shakespeare wrote.</p>

<p class="center">BOILEAU</p>

<p>A great genius ought to guide, not servilely follow, the taste of his
contemporaries.</p>

<p class="center">POPE</p>

<p>Consider from how thick a darkness of barbarism the genius of
Shakespeare broke forth! What were the English, and what (let me
ask you) were the French dramatic performances, in the age when he
flourished? The advances he made towards the highest perfection both of
tragedy and comedy are amazing! In the principal points, in the power
of exciting terror and pity, or raising laughter in an audience, none
yet has excelled him, and very few have equalled.</p>

<p class="center">BOILEAU</p>

<p>Do you think he was equal in comedy to Moliere?</p>

<p class="center">POPE</p>

<p>In <em>comic force</em> I do: but in the fine and delicate strokes of satire,
and what is called <em>genteel comedy</em>, he was greatly inferior to
that admirable writer. There is nothing in him to compare with the
<cite>Misanthrope</cite>, the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Ecole des Femmes</i>, or <cite>Tartuffe</cite>.</p>

<p class="center"><!-- Page 294 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
BOILEAU</p>

<p>This, Mr. Pope, is a great deal for an Englishman to acknowledge.
A veneration for Shakespeare seems to be a part of your national
religion, and the only part in which even your men of sense are
fanatics.</p>

<p class="center">POPE</p>

<p>He who can read Shakespeare, and be cool enough for all the accuracy of
sober criticism, has more of reason than taste.</p>

<p class="center">BOILEAU</p>

<p>I join with you in admiring him as a prodigy of genius, though I find
the most shocking absurdities in his plays; absurdities which no critic
of my nation can pardon.</p>

<p class="center">POPE</p>

<p>We will be satisfied with your feeling the excellence of his beauties.</p>

<h3>LAURENCE STERNE, 1768<br />

(1713-1768)</h3>

<p class="quotetitle">“<cite>The Passport—Versailles.</cite>”</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">I could</span> not conceive why the Count de B&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;* had gone so abruptly
out of the room, any more than I could conceive why he had put the
Shakespeare into his pocket—<em>Mysteries which must explain themselves,
are not worth the loss of time which a conjecture about them takes
up</em>: it was better to read Shakespeare; so, taking up <cite>Much Ado about
Nothing</cite>, I transported myself instantly from the chair I sat in to
Messina in Sicily, and got so busy with Don Pedro and Benedick and
Beatrice, that I thought not of Versailles, the Count, or the Passport.</p>

<p>Sweet pliability of man’s spirit, that can at once surrender itself
to illusions, which cheat expectation and sorrow of their wearied
moments!—long, long since had you numbered out my days, had I not trod
so great a part of them upon this enchanted ground: when my way is too
rough for my feet, or too steep for my strength, I get off it, to some
smooth velvet path which fancy has scattered over with rosebuds of
delights; and, having taken a few turns in it, come back strengthened
and refreshed—When evils press sore upon me, and there is no retreat
from them in this world, then I take a new course—I leave it—and as I
have a clearer idea of the Elysian fields than I have of <!-- Page 296 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>heaven, I
force myself, like Æneas, into them—I see him meet the pensive shade
of his forsaken Dido—and wish to recognise it—I see the injured spirit
wave her head, and turn off silent from the author of her miseries
and dishonours—I lose the feelings for myself in hers—and in those
affections which were wont to make me mourn for her when I was at
school.</p>

<p><em>Surely this is not walking in a vain shadow—nor does man disquiet
himself</em> in vain <em>by it</em>—he oftener does so in trusting the issue of
his commotions to reason only—I can safely say for myself, I was never
able to conquer any one single bad sensation in my heart so decisively,
as by beating up as fast as I could some kindly and gentle sensation,
to fight it upon its own ground.</p>

<p>When I had got to the end of the third act, the Count de B&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*
entered with my passport in his hand. M. Le Duc de C&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*, said the
Count, is as good a prophet, I dare say, as he is a statesman—<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Un homme
qui rit</i>, said the Duke, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">ne sera jamais dangereux</i>. Had it been for
any one but the King’s jester, added the Count, I could not have got
it these two hours—<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Pardonnez moi</i>, M. Le Compte, said I—I am not the
King’s jester—But you are Yorick?—Yes—<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Et vous plaisantez?</i>—I answered,
Indeed I did jest—but was not paid for it—it was entirely at my own
expense.</p>

<p>We have no jester at court, M. Le Compte, said I—the last we had was
in the licentious reign of Charles <span class="allcapsc">II.</span>—since which time our
manners have been so gradually refining, that our court at present is
so full of patriots, who wish for <em>nothing</em> but the honours and wealth
of their country—and our ladies are all so chaste, so spotless, so
<!-- Page 297 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>good, so devout—there is nothing for a jester to make a jest of—</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">My</span> histrionic acquaintance spreads. I supped at Lady Dorothy Hotham’s
with Mrs. Siddons, have visited and been visited by her, and have
seen and liked her much, yes, very much, in the passionate scenes in
“Percy”; but I do not admire her in cool declamation, and find her
voice very hollow and defective. I asked her in which part she would
most wish me to see her? She named Portia in the “Merchant of Venice”;
but I begged to be excused. With all my enthusiasm for Shakespeare, it
is one of his plays that I like the least. The story of the caskets is
silly, and, except the character of Shylock, I see nothing beyond the
attainment of a mortal; Euripides, or Racine, or Voltaire might have
written all the rest.</p>

<h3>NATHANIEL HAWTHORNE, 1845<br />

(1804-1864)</h3>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">The</span> human race had now reached a stage of progress so far beyond what
the wisest and wittiest men of former ages had ever dreamed of, that
it would have been a manifest absurdity to allow the earth to be any
longer encumbered with their poor achievements in the literary line.
Accordingly, a thorough and searching investigation had swept the
booksellers’ shops, hawkers’ stands, public and private libraries, and
even the little bookshelf by the country fireside, and had brought the
world’s entire mass of printed paper, bound or in sheets, to swell
the already mountain-bulk of our illustrious bonfire. Thick, heavy
folios, containing the labours of lexicographers, commentators, and
encyclopedists, were flung in, and, falling among the embers with a
leaden thump, smouldered away to ashes, like rotten wood. The small,
richly-gilt French tomes of the last age, with the hundred volumes of
Voltaire among them, went off in a brilliant shower of sparkles, and
little jets of flame; while the current literature of the same nation
burnt red and blue, and threw an infernal light over the visages of
the spectators, converting them all to the aspect of parti-coloured
fiends. A collection of German stories emitted a scent of brimstone.
The English standard authors made excellent fuel, generally exhibiting
the properties of sound oak logs. Milton’s works, in particular, sent
up a powerful blaze, gradually reddening into a coal, which promised
to endure longer than almost any other <!-- Page 315 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>material of the pile. From
Shakespeare there gushed a flame of such marvellous splendour, that men
shaded their eyes as against the sun’s meridian glory; nor even when
the works of his own elucidators were flung upon him, did he cease to
flash forth a dazzling radiance beneath the ponderous heap. It is my
belief that he is still blazing as fervidly as ever.</p>

<p>“Could a poet but light a lamp at that glorious flame,” remarked I, “he
might then consume the midnight oil to some good purpose.”</p>

<p>“That is the very thing which modern poets have been too apt to do,
or at least to attempt,” answered a critic. “The chief benefit to be
expected from this conflagration of past literature undoubtedly is,
that writers will henceforth be compelled to light their lamps at the
sun or stars.”</p>

<h3>WALTER SAVAGE LANDOR, 1846<br />

(1775-1864)</h3>

<p class="quotetitle">“<cite>Shakespeare and Bacon.</cite>”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Southey.</span>—In so wide and untrodden a creation as that of
Shakespeare’s, can we wonder or complain that sometimes we are
bewildered and entangled in the exuberance of fertility? Dry-brained
men upon the continent, the trifling wits of the theatre, accurate
however and expert calculators, tell us that his beauties are balanced
by his faults. The poetical opposition, puffing for popularity, cry
cheerily against them, <em>his faults are balanced by his beauties</em>; when,
in reality, all the faults that ever were committed in poetry would be
but as air to earth, if we could weigh them against one single thought
or image, such as almost every scene exhibits in every drama of this
unrivalled genius. Do you hear me with patience?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Porson.</span>—With more; although at Cambridge we rather discourse
on Bacon, for we know him better. He was immeasurably a less wise man
than Shakespeare, and not a wiser writer: for he knew his fellow-man
only as he saw him in the street and in the Court, which indeed is but
a dirtier street and a narrower; Shakespeare, who also knew him there,
knew him everywhere else, both as he was and as he might be.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Southey.</span>—There is as great a difference between Shakespeare
and Bacon as between an American forest and a London timber-yard. In
the timber-yard the materials are <!-- Page 317 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>sawed and squared and set across; in
the forest we have the natural form of the tree, all its growth, all
its branches, all its leaves, all the mosses that grow about it, all
the birds and insects that inhabit it; now deep shadows absorbing the
whole wilderness; now bright bursting glades, with exuberant grass and
flower and fruitage; now untroubled skies; now terrific thunderstorms;
everywhere multiformity, everywhere immensity.</p>

<h3>JUDGE WILLIS, 1902<br />

(<abbr title="born"><i>b.</i></abbr> 1835)</h3>

<p class="quotetitle">“<cite>Examination of Edward Blount, one of the printers and
publishers of the Shakespeare folio of 1623.</cite>”</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">Did</span> you never hear that Shakespeare the actor, whom you knew, had
nothing to do with the pieces published under his name?</p>

<p>I never did.</p>

<p>Did you never hear that the name “Shakespeare,” that is, with the “e”
after the “k,” was assumed to cover and conceal the writings of a very
great, distinguished man?</p>

<p>I never did.</p>

<p>Would you be surprised to hear that Lord Bacon—</p>

<p>The reporter says that as soon as this word escaped from Counsel’s
lips, the whole Court was convulsed with laughter, in which the jury
joined.</p>

<p>To save appearances, the learned Judge retired into his private room,
as he said, in order to fetch his copy of “Venus and Adonis.” His
laughter was heard in the hall.</p>

<p>“We noticed,” says the reporter, “that Mr. Jonson never smiled. He
seemed deeply moved, and exclaimed, ‘What next? And next?’”</p>

<p>On the return of the Judge, the laughter had not quite subsided, and
the usher cried “Order, Order.”</p>

<p>The Judge, on again taking his seat, said to the Counsel for the
defence, “I am sorry, sir, your question should have been so received,
but you must remember the spectators <!-- Page 327 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span>are human, and that the jury and
myself are not free from infirmity. We are, however, quite impartial.”</p>

<p>The Counsel resumed.</p>

<p>Now that this indecent laughter is over, tell me, sir, do you not know
that Lord Bacon was the author of the plays contained in the folio
volume?</p>

<p>I do not know it, and never until now have I heard a doubt cast upon
the authorship of Shakespeare.</p>

<p>Did you never have any communication from Lord Bacon in respect of the
publishing the folio volume?</p>

<p>Never. I never received a paper of any kind from him, nor did I
communicate any portion of the manuscript to him.</p>

<p>Did not Mr. Benjamin Jonson bring you the manuscripts, or some of them,
from which you printed?</p>

<p>“My lord, my lord!” said Jonson.</p>

<p>“Pray be quiet, Mr. Jonson, you will have your turn directly,” said the
Judge.</p>

<p>He did not, nor did he touch any sheet of them. As I have told you, I
never communicated with him until I spoke to him about writing some
lines for the portrait.</p>

<p>Did not Mr. Jonson write the Dedication or Preface?</p>

<p>He wrote neither. Heminge and Condell wrote the Dedication, and the
Address to the Readers they composed in consultation with myself.</p>

<p>Did you not receive money from some one in order to induce you to print
the folio?</p>

<p>I did not. I looked to the sale, and the sale only, to recoup myself
and my co-adventurers.</p>

<p><em>Re-examined.</em>—I myself never touched the manuscripts, nor added a line
to them. After they were in my <!-- Page 328 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span>possession, Heminge and Condell never,
to my knowledge, altered the manuscripts, nor did any one else.</p>

<p>I could, if necessary, have written a Dedication and the Address to the
Readers. I wrote a work entitled “A Hospital for Incurable Fools.” I
hope some day such hospital will be founded.</p>

introductory volume, containing A History of Opinion on the Writings
of Shakspere; with the Chronology of his Plays</cite>. The book in this form
seems now to be difficult of access. No copy of it is in the British
Museum Library. I acquired a copy for a few pence many years ago.</p>

killed; and in Quarles’ <cite>Argalus and Parthenia</cite>, the expression “to

seems to echo the passage in <cite>King John</cite>, “to gild refined gold, to

spirit in his <cite>Rambler</cite>:</p>

<p>“It may be doubtful whether from all his successors more maxims of
theoretical knowledge, or more rules of practical prudence, can be
collected than he alone has given to his country.”—<cite>Works</cite>, v. 131.</p>

<p>“He that has read Shakespeare with attention will, perhaps, find little
new in the crowded world.”—<abbr title="Ibidem"><i>Ib.</i></abbr> 434.</p>

<p>“Let him that is yet unacquainted with the powers of Shakespeare, and
who desires to feel the highest pleasure that the drama can give, read
every play, from the first scene to the last, with utter negligence of
all his commentators. When his fancy is on the wing, let it not stoop
at correction or explanation.”—<abbr title="Ibidem"><i>Ib.</i></abbr> 152.</p>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_26:1_5" id="Footnote_26:1_5"></a><a href="#FNanchor_26:1_5"><span class="label">[26:1]</span></a> A word may be said here of the eighteenth century
anthologists. Collections of poems were numerous. That by Dodsley, with
its supplement prepared by Pearch, contains nothing by Shakespeare,
nor indeed does Nichols’ collection, which claimed to include no poem
that had been printed in the volumes issued by Dodsley or Pearch. A
collection by Thomas Tomkins, entitled <cite>Poems on Various Subjects:
selected to enforce the Practice of Virtue, and with a View to comprise
in One Volume the Beauties of English Poetry</cite> (1787), goes no farther
back than Milton; and the well-known anthology, <cite>Select Beauties of
Ancient English Poetry</cite>, with remarks by Henry Headley, contains such
names as Drayton, Warner, Drummond, Raleigh, Surrey, Carew, Wyat,
and Browne, but Shakespeare finds no place. He does not, in fact,
enter regularly collections of this kind until the beginning of the
nineteenth century—the period of “Elegant Extracts.” But he is quoted
frequently enough in Edward Bysshe’s <cite>Art of English Poetry</cite> (1724);
and John Bowle, in his <cite>Miscellaneous Pieces of Ancient English Poetry</cite>
(1765), selects from <cite>King John</cite>.</p>

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.

terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org/license

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
